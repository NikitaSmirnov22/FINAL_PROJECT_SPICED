Check;Once you recognize an emergency you must first check the scene, then check the person. Before rushing to help an ill or injured person, stop and take a good look at the scene. This will form an initial impression. Try to answer these questions: Is the scene safe for you, the ill or injured person, and any bystanders? Enter a scene only if it is safe to do so. Look for hazards such as spilled chemicals, hostile bystanders, or oncoming traffic. Listen for things such as ringing alarms or leaking gas. Smell for things such as gas or smoke. Avoid entering confined areas with poor ventilation and places where there is a risk of explosion (e.g., from leaking propane or natural gas). Do not enter the scene if the person is hostile or threatening suicide. If hazards are present, stay at a safe distance and call EMS. Leave dangerous situations for EMS personnel. Once EMS personnel arrive and make the scene safe, you can offer your assistance as appropriate. Remember that conditions at the scene may change, so a safe area could quickly become dangerous. It is important to continuously monitor your surroundings even if your initial assessment revealed a low level of risk. What happened? How did it happen? Take note of anything that might reveal the cause of the emergency. If the person is unresponsive and there are no witnesses, your check of the scene may offer the only clues as to what happened. Use your senses to detect anything out of the ordinary, such as broken glass, a spilled bottle of medication, or an unusual smell or sound. Keep in mind that the ill or injured person may not be exactly where he or she was when the emergency occurred—someone may have moved the person, or the person may have moved in an attempt to get help. How many ill or injured people are there? Look carefully for more than one ill or injured person. A person who is moving or making noise, or who has very visible injuries, will likely attract your attention right away, but there may be a person who is silent and not moving or a person obscured by debris or wreckage who you do not notice at first. It is also easy to overlook a small child or a baby. Is there someone to help? Take note of bystanders who can be of assistance. A bystander who was there when the emergency occurred or who knows the person may be able to provide valuable information. Bystanders can also assist in other ways, such as by calling EMS/1-1-2, waiting for EMS personnel and leading them to the site of the emergency, getting needed items (such as an AED and first aid kit), controlling crowds, and reassuring the injured or ill person. What is your initial impression of the ill or injured person? Before you reach the person, try to form an initial impression about the person’s condition and what is wrong. For example, does the person seem alert, confused, or sleepy? Look at the person’s skin—does it appear to be its normal colour, or does it seem pale, ashen (grey), or flushed? Is the person moving or motionless? Does the person have any immediately identifiable injuries? Look for signs of a life-threatening illness or injury, such as unresponsiveness, trouble breathing, or life-threatening bleeding. 
Check the Person;If it is safe to do so, quickly check the person to determine his or her initial condition and whether there are any life-threatening concerns. This is called the primary assessment. 1. Check the person to see if he or she is responsive: Does the person respond when you talk to him or her (e.g., does the person open his or her eyes, move, moan, or talk to you)? Does the person respond when tapped on the shoulder? A person who does not respond at all is considered to be unresponsive. 2. Check the person’s ABCs: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.
Check the Airway;Your first job is to make sure the person has an open airway. The airway is the pathway that connects the mouth and nose to the lungs. If it is closed or blocked, air cannot get in. The airway is most commonly blocked by the tongue. If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person’s airway is open. If the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chin-lift. The head-tilt moves the back of the tongue away from the airway, and the chin-lift opens the epiglottis.
Performing the Head-Tilt or Chin-Lift;To perform a head-tilt/chin-lift, place one hand on the person’s forehead and 2 or 3 fingers under the chin. Gently tilt the head back until the chin is pointing upward.
Check Breathing;Next, check for breathing. Someone who can speak or cry is breathing. Check for normal breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. To assess breathing, put your cheek close to the person’s face so that you can hear and feel air coming out of the person’s nose and mouth while you watch the chest rising and falling. A person is breathing normally if air is moving in and out of the lungs and the chest is rising and falling in a normal, regular pattern. 
Agonal Respiration;"A person who is not breathing normally may be occasionally gasping for air: this is a reflex action called ""agonal respiration"" and unlike normal breathing, it is irregular and sporadic. Because agonal respiration does not oxygenate the blood, it is not considered normal breathing. A person who is experiencing agonal respiration is in cardiac arrest and requires immediate assistance. Agonal respirations originate from lower brainstem neurons as higher centres become increasingly hypoxic (oxygendeprived) during cardiac arrest. With agonal respiration, the diaphragm is still receiving intermittent residual impulses from the brain, resulting in sporadic gasping breaths. Agonal respiration is sometimes referred to as ""air hunger"" and it can appear as snorting, gurgling, moaning or gasping, a gaping mouth, or laboured breathing. The duration differs from person to person, lasting from a few minutes to hours."
Check Circulation;If the person is breathing normally (more than an occasional gasp), his or her heart is beating. Checking circulation means quickly looking at the person from head to toe for signs of life-threatening external bleeding. Life-threatening bleeding must be controlled as soon as possible. Unresponsiveness, trouble breathing, and life-threatening bleeding are all signs of a life-threatening emergency. If your initial check of the person reveals any of these conditions, you must provide care for that condition immediately. Make sure that someone calls EMS right away, and obtain an AED and first aid kit if these items are available.
Obvious Signs of Death;"Obvious signs of death include: Torso transection (torso cut into two pieces); Decapitation (detached head); Decomposition If you encounter a person with one or more of these signs, call EMS and follow the dispatcher’s instructions. Leave the body and scene exactly as they were found, as the area could be considered a crime scene. Rolling a Person from a Face-Down to a Face-Up Position A person can collapse in a variety of positions. If a person is lying face down, is unresponsive, and not breathing, or if the face-down position makes it impossible to check the person’s ABCs, then the person must be rolled into a face-up position without delay. Move an ill or injured person only if: The person’s position stops you from giving care for a lifethreatening injury or illness. The person is blocking access to someone with a more serious injury or illness. The scene is becoming unsafe. To roll a person from a face-down to a face-up position: support the head while rolling the person, try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at one time), open the airway with a head-tilt or chin-lift once the person is facing upward. Check the person’s ABCs."
Call;"If you identify an unresponsive individual or an individual with a life threatening condition in your initial check, you must always activate EMS. Whenever possible, use a mobile phone or ask a bystander to call EMS. Having someone else call is better than doing it yourself; this way, you can stay with the ill or injured person and continue to give first aid. If you are alone with the person and you do not 1. Support the head while rolling the person. 2. Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at one time). 3. Open the airway with a head-tilt/chin-lift once the person is facing upward. 4. Check the person’s ABCs. have a mobile phone, call out loudly for help. If no one comes, get to a phone as quickly as you can and call EMS. As soon as you hang up, return to the person. If someone else has to leave to make the call for you, ask that person to come back and tell you what the EMS dispatcher said. If using a mobile phone, the person can stay with you while placing the call and speaking to the dispatcher."
If You Are Alone: Call First or Care First?;If you are alone without a phone and there is no one to send to call EMS, you may need to decide whether to call first or give care first. Unless the situation specifically requires you to provide care before calling EMS, you should always activate EMS first so that help will Check, Call, Care arrive as soon as possible. You should provide care first in the following situations: The person is choking or is experiencing anaphylaxis and carrying epinephrine. In these cases, the person could die before EMS arrives, so providing immediate care is your highest priority. Moreover, these situations can be corrected by First Aiders, so immediate care may actually improve the person’s condition. If a person experiencing anaphylaxis is not carrying epinephrine, there is little that you can do as a First Aider, so you should call EMS first before providing care. The person has life-threatening bleeding Life-threatening bleeding quickly reduces the body’s blood volume, which can be fatal. Apply direct pressure immediately, then call EMS as soon as possible. In many cases, the person will be able to apply pressure to his or her own injury while you (or a bystander) call EMS. The person is an unresponsive child or baby who is not breathing. Children’s organs require high levels of oxygen in the blood to function efficiently and can rapidly shut down when oxygen levels are lowered. For this reason, cardiac arrest in children is more likely to be caused by low oxygen levels than by a problem with the heart itself. If you find a non-breathing child or baby who is unresponsive, you must introduce oxygen into his or her system as soon as possible. Immediately do 2 minutes of CPR (5 cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths) to increase the oxygen level, then quickly call EMS before returning to provide more care.
When You Call EMS(1-1-2);When you call, the EMS dispatcher who answers will likely ask: Where is the emergency (e.g., the address, nearby intersections, or landmarks)? What is the nature of the emergency (i.e., is police, fire, or medical assistance needed)? What telephone number are you calling from? What is your name? What has happened? How many people are involved and what is their condition? Don’t hang up until the dispatcher tells you to. The dispatcher may need more information. Many dispatchers are also trained to give first aid and CPR instructions over the phone, which can be helpful if you are unsure of what to do or need to be reminded of the proper care steps.
Radio Medical Advice in a Marine Environment;In a marine environment, it may not be possible for EMS personnel to come to your assistance in an emergency. You may need to contact a doctor and request advice on providing care, even if it is outside of your training. Document the doctor’s orders carefully. Medical advice can be accessed by: mobile phone, radiotelephone contact with a shore radio station, radiotelephone contact with a nearby port or ship with a doctor on board. You should prepare the following information and present it to the doctor: routine information about the ship, routine information about the person, details of the illness or injury, findings from your secondary assessment, care rendered and the person’s response to that care Transport Germany provides a reference regarding radiotelephone procedures, which should be displayed next to your vessel’s radiotelephone. The procedures in this reference advise that safety and distress radio messages should be made on Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) or on frequency 2,182 kHz, MF.
Care;Care for any life-threatening conditions first. Give the care that is needed, within the scope of your knowledge and training, and follow these general guidelines: monitor the person’s breathing and level of responsiveness, help the person rest in the most comfortable position. If necessary, roll the person into the recovery position, keep the person from getting chilled or overheated, reassure the person by repeating that you are there to help and that EMS personnel have been called (if this is true), continue to watch for changes in the person’s condition.
Recovery Position;A person who is unresponsive or has an altered level of responsiveness should not be left in a face-up position, as the airway can become blocked by the person’s tongue or the person’s saliva or other bodily fluids. You can help protect the airway by rolling the person onto his or her side and into the recovery position. It is usually safest for any ill or injured person to be in the recovery position, so long as this doesn’t interfere with providing care. However, the recovery position is unnecessary if the person is fully responsive and able to protect his or her own airway. You should avoid rolling a person if doing so could worsen his or her condition (e.g., if the person’s leg appears to be broken). As always, you should move the person only if it is safe to do so. To roll a person safely into the recovery position: 1.Raise the person’s arm that is closest to you. 2. Place the arm farther from you across the person’s chest with the palm against the cheek. 3. Raise the knee of the leg farther from you. 4. Roll the person toward you as one unit by pulling the raised knee and supporting the head and neck with your other hand 5. Position the person on his or her side, and slide the bent knee into a position that prevents the person from rolling onto his or her face. 6. Move the person’s other arm into a position of comfort in front of the body. 7. Reassess the person’s ABCs. The steps above are recommended, but there are other effective methods of moving a person into the recovery position. Regardless of how you do it, the important things to remember are as follows: Support and protect the head while rolling the person. Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at the same time). Roll the person into a position where the body will stay safely on its side. Position the head so that it keeps the airway open. Check the ABCs after you complete the roll.
When to Stop Giving Care;Once you begin providing care to an injured or ill person, you must continue to give the appropriate care until: Another trained First Aider or EMS personnel takes over. You are too exhausted to continue. The scene becomes unsafe.
When More Than One Person Is Ill or Injured;If you are in a situation where there are several ill or injured people, the general principle is to provide care to the people who need it the most urgently. This involves deciding whose illness or injuries pose the greatest risks, as well as deciding who you are most able to help given your level of training. The process of sorting and providing care for multiple ill or injured people according to the severity of their conditions is called triage. As an example, if one person has minor bleeding and another person has life-threatening bleeding, you should help the person with life threatening bleeding first. EMS personnel will arrive before the minor bleeding becomes serious.
Guidelines for Helping an Ill or Injured Person with Medication;You should only help a person take his or her medication if: , It is safe to do so. , The person is responsive and has in some way expressed a need for help with finding, preparing, and/or taking the medication. When helping someone with his or her medication, check the label to ensure that it is the correct medication and, if it is a prescription medication, that it was prescribed for the person who will be taking it. You should also carefully read over any instructions or warnings (e.g., how much the person should take and when it should be taken). You should read the label at least twice: once when you find the medication, and again before you give it to the person. If there is no name on the label, confirm with the person that it is the medication he or she wants to take. You must also ask if the person has any allergies or is taking anything that could interfere with or react negatively with the medication. Quickly review these details with the ill or injured person and obtain his or her permission before helping.
Finding the Medication;When helping a responsive ill or injured person find his or her medication, listen to instructions from the person on where to find it. If the person cannot speak, look in places where people typically keep their medication (e.g., backpack, purse, or pocket), or look for physical cues from the person (e.g., the person pointing at a bag). If the person cannot speak and you are helping with prescription medication, ask the person to confirm the name on the label by using physical signals (shaking or nodding the head, blinking once or twice, etc.). If the person is unable to do this, you may be able to confirm the person’s identity by asking bystanders, looking for a piece of photo ID, or checking for a medical identification product
Preparing the Medication;Preparing the person’s medication varies depending on the type of the medication and its instructions. For example, preparing oral medication may simply involve handing the person the correct number of tablets. In the case of an inhaler or auto-injector, you may have to remove the cover and follow the preparation instructions provided on the package before handing it to the person for self-administration. 
Guiding the Person in Taking the Medication;Guiding the person in taking his or her medication also varies depending on the type of medication. For example, with tablets, this may involve telling the person to chew them or place them under the tongue. With an inhaler, this may involve instructing the person to shake the inhaler and exhale before dispensing the medication, or helping the person hold the inhaler to his or her mouth. When simply guiding the person, you do not press on the inhaler’s plunger yourself. With an auto-injector, you may guide the person by showing where on the outer thigh the epinephrine should be injected.
Giving Lifesaving Medication;Giving lifesaving medication involves helping an ill or injured person who has in some way expressed a need for help in taking his or her salbutamol (Ventolin) inhaler or using an epinephrine auto-injector. With an inhaler, you would dispense the correct number of sprays (from a metered-dose inhaler) either into a spacer or directly into the person’s mouth as he or she inhales. With an auto-injector, you would inject the epinephrine directly into the person’s outer thigh.
Giving Ingested Medications;Helping with ingested medications should be limited to finding the medication, preparing the medication, and guiding the person in taking the medication. In cases where the person is physically unable to get the medication into his or her mouth (e.g., the person has injured his or her hands), First Aiders may assist by placing the correct number of pills into the mouth or holding a liquid dispenser up to the person’s mouth, if the person has explicitly asked the First Aider to do so. Otherwise, you should never put anything into a person’s mouth, as this can be a choking hazard.
Secondary Assessment;After you have identified and cared for any life-threatening conditions found in the primary assessment, you must check the person for other injuries and conditions that may require care. This is called the secondary assessment. If the person’s ABCs seem normal, do a secondary assessment to look for injuries or conditions that were not identified in your primary assessment. The secondary assessment consists of three steps: 1. Asking questions 2. Checking the quality of the person’s vital signs 3. Doing an injury check. 
Interviewing an injured person;Interview the ill or injured person (if he or she is responsive) and any bystanders at the scene to get more information. Asking the following sample questions can provide useful information about the person’s situation: Do you have any cuts or bruises? How do you feel? Do you feel any pain? Does anything feel different? Are you allergic to anything? Do you take any medicine? What is it for? Do you have any medical conditions such as heart disease or other illnesses? Has this happened before? When did you last eat or drink? What did you have? What happened?
Check the Vital Signs;Check the quality of the person’s vital signs by evaluating his or her level of responsiveness, breathing, and skin. Level of Responsiveness: Is the person alert or sleepy? Does the person seem confused? Is the person’s awareness increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? Breathing: Listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Effective or adequate? Shallow or deep? Is breathing painful for the person? Skin: Is it dry or wet? Is it an unusual colour or temperature? A person’s respiratory rate directly impacts the amount of oxygen that enters his or her bloodstream. Slower breathing brings less air into the lungs in a given period, and therefore decreases the amount of oxygen that crosses into the bloodstream. Breathing that is either too fast or too slow can also throw off the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in a person’s blood. In a first aid emergency, a person’s breathing rate can be affected by injury, blood loss, shock, pain, and anxiety. Providing continual care can help restore the person’s breathing rate to normal. An ill or injured person’s skin may lose its underlying red tones, becoming more grey or white than usual. In people with darker skin, these changes may be harder to identify: skin may appear ashen-grey, yellow-brown or grayish-green. Changes may be most easily visible on the inside of the lips, the nail beds, or the skin around the mouth, which may be paler or have a dark blue tone due to the blueish tint of deoxygenated blood. The important thing is to note any changes from the person’s normal skin tone, if possible.
Injury Check;The goal of an injury check is to look carefully for injuries that were not identified during the primary assessment. An injury check may involve a focused examination or a hands-on check, depending on the comfort level of the person and whether the person is responsive.
Focused Examination;If the person is responsive and able to answer questions, do a focused examination. Keep watching the person’s vital signs. If the person’s condition deteriorates, stop the examination and give first aid immediately. To do a focused examination: 1. Explain that the purpose of the examination is to identify injuries. 2. Ask the person if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable. 3. If the person indicates an area of pain, discomfort, or concern, look at the area for signs of injury including discolouration (bruises) or deformities (odd shapes). For privacy reasons, do not remove any of the person’s clothing unless it makes providing first aid difficult. 4. If there are no signs of any injury, ask focused questions about how the person feels. The symptoms the person describes might help to determine whether EMS/9-1-1 needs to be called and what kinds of care should be provided. 5. If you find a medical identification product, be sure to read it carefully. It may indicate what is wrong, who to call for help, and what care to give. 6. If the person doesn’t complain of any pain or tenderness, and there are no signs of injuries, ask the person to rest for a few minutes in a comfortable position. Check the quality of the person’s vital signs and ensure the ABCs are still unaffected. If there is no visible problem, help the person to stand up slowly when he or she is ready. 7. Based on your findings, decide whether you need to call EMS, and provide first aid care as needed.
Hands-On Check;If a person is breathing but unresponsive, or is otherwise unable to communicate what is wrong, you may need to do a hands-on check to assess whether further first aid is required. Conducting a hands-on check involves systematically checking the person from head to toe for signs of injury. Look and feel for any abnormalities such as bumps, soft spots, deformity, bruising, and bleeding. You should also look at the ground around the person for signs of blood or other body fluids. Continue to watch the person’s ABCs and vital signs as you perform this check. If the person’s condition deteriorates, stop the hands-on check and give first aid immediately. Begin by checking the head, then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking the arms. This prioritises the areas that are more prone to life-threatening bleeding and organ damage. When checking the chest, feel the ribs for signs of deformity. If the person is unresponsive, watch the rib cage as the person breathes. Both sides should expand at the same time. If the person is responsive, ask him or her to take a deep breath (if it doesn’t cause any pain) to make it easier to check the expansion of the rib cage. When checking the abdomen, press on it gently. It should be soft to the touch. If it feels hard or gentle pressure is painful, check carefully for bruising (some of the person’s clothes may need to be moved or removed at this point). Pushing on a person’s injured pelvis can cause serious injury or worsen an existing condition, so this area should not be touched during the hands-on check.
Continual Care;A person’s condition can change while you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive. Do the following to provide continual care: 1. Have the person rest. 2. Help the person maintain a normal body temperature. 3. Monitor the person’s condition and ABCs. 4. Move the person into the recovery position, if necessary. 5. Give comfort and reassurance to the person. Helping the person stay calm has physiological benefits, such as decreasing the heart rate, reducing pain, slowing and deepening breathing, stabilising blood pressure, and relaxing the body’s muscles. To help a person calm down and control his or her breathing: 1. Encourage the person to maintain eye contact with you. 2. Have the person breathe in through his or her nose while you raise your arm and count to five. Breathe with the person. 3. Have the person breathe out through his or her mouth, making an audible sound, while you slowly lower your arm and count to ten. 4. Repeat 3 to 5 times, providing encouragement in a calm voice.
Should You Transport an Ill or Injured Person to the Hospital?;You may decide to take the ill or injured person to a hospital, urgent care clinic, doctor’s office, or community first aid station if: The person is a friend or family member. The person’s injuries are minor and non-life-threatening. There is no risk of the person’s condition getting worse. There is no risk of the person experiencing an altered level of responsiveness. If you decide it is safe to transport the person yourself, take someone else with you, if possible, to help keep the ill or injured person comfortable and to watch for any changes in his or her condition. This will let you focus on driving safely. Remember to obey traffic laws. No one will benefit if you are involved in a motor vehicle collision or get a speeding ticket on your way to the medical facility. Never let an ill or injured person drive a motor vehicle for any reason. Driving is a high-risk activity that requires concentration, so getting behind the wheel while ill or injured is extremely dangerous. Even a person whose condition is mild could get worse while he or she is driving, and his or her ability to safely operate the vehicle could easily be compromised. Remember that it is not only the health and safety of the driver that is at stake, but that of everyone else on and near the road.
Shock;A person who is ill or injured may go into shock. Shock happens when the vital organs do not get enough oxygenrich blood. Shock is a life-threatening condition.
Common Causes;Be on the lookout for shock when providing care for any injury or sudden illness, or when someone has been involved in a serious incident (even if he or she is not badly injured). Shock is often caused by significant fluid loss, for example, diarrhea and vomiting. This is especially true in children, who can become dehydrated more easily. Other causes of shock include the following: Significant blood loss, Heart damage, Extensive burns, Infection, Anaphylaxis, Severe infection. What to Look For The following are signs and symptoms of shock: Anxiety, Cool, clammy skin, Skin that is paler than normal, Weakness, Confusion, Excessive thirst, Rapid breathing, Drowsiness or loss of responsiveness, Nausea and vomiting. What to Do The best thing you can do when a person is in shock is to call EMS. While you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive, provide care by: 1. Caring for the cause of the shock. 2. Having the person rest. 3. Keeping the person warm. 4. Monitoring the person’s ABCs. 5. Providing comfort and reassurance.
Providing First Aid for Someone with a Disability;It is not uncommon to feel intimidated when providing first aid to a person who has different abilities, because there is often uncertainty about how to care for the person. Remember that people are more similar than they are different, both physiologically and psychologically, and most aspects of first aid care do not vary from person to person. Remember that a person’s particular needs may not be visible, and that the person (or the person’s direct caregiver) is the best source of information about his or her unique situation. If you are unsure, ask what you can do to help. The person is likely to appreciate your consideration.
General Tips for Providing First Aid to a Person with a Disability;Remember the following tips when providing care for a person with any type of disability: As with all first aid, you need permission to help and should explain what you intend to do. These basic principles do not change because the person has different abilities. Avoid stereotypes and make no assumptions about what abilities the person has or does not have. Remember that not all disabilities are visible. Be confident and reassuring. If you cannot understand what the person is saying, politely ask him or her to repeat it. Don’t touch or speak to service animals. They are working and have to pay attention at all times. Get permission before touching assistive devices, including wheelchairs.
Providing First Aid for Someone with Vision Loss;Examples of vision loss include tunnel vision (where a person cannot see objects to the side), lack of central vision, and total blindness, in which the person receives no visual information from the world around them. Most people with vision loss still have some degree of sight. Keep the following in mind when providing first aid to an individual with vision loss: If you need to leave the person, let him or her know that you are leaving and will be back. Narrate your actions so that the person can follow what you are doing. If you’re unsure about how to provide directions, simply ask the person how he or she would like you to do so.
Providing First Aid for Someone with Hearing Loss;Keep the following points in mind when providing first aid to an individual with any type of hearing loss: Get the person’s attention before speaking. The best way to do this is usually by lightly touching the person’s shoulder or gently waving your hand. Ask the person how you can help. Don’t shout. If communication is difficult, ask if the person prefers to communicate in another way, such as using a pen and paper. Be patient if you are using a pen and paper to communicate. American Sign Language may be the person’s first language and it has its own grammatical rules and sentence structure. If the person uses a hearing aid and you are having trouble communicating, minimise background noise or move to a quieter area, if possible.
Providing First Aid for Someone Who Is Deafblind;Deaf-blind describes people who have some degree of both vision and hearing loss. Many people who are deaf-blind are accompanied by an intervenor (a professional who helps with communication). If an intervenor is accompanying the person, tell him or her who you are, but then speak directly to the ill or injured person. Don’t touch the person abruptly and don’t touch the person without permission.
Providing First Aid for Someone with a Physical Disability;There are many different types of physical disability, and not all of them are visible. The important thing is not to diagnose the person: what matters is determining whether the conditions you encounter are pre-existing or whether they are signs of the injury or illness you are providing care for. Keep the following tips in mind when providing first aid to an individual with a physical disability: Speak naturally to the person (physical and mental disabilities are not the same thing). Adjust your position if necessary so that you can make eye contact with the person while providing care.
Providing First Aid for Someone with an Intellectual or a Developmental Disability;It may not be apparent that a person has an intellectual or developmental disability unless this fact is communicated to you. Keep the following points in mind when providing first aid to an individual with an intellectual or a developmental disability: As much as possible, interact with the person as you would with anyone else in the same situation. Use straightforward language when communicating. Give one piece of information at a time.
Providing First Aid for Someone with a Speech or Language Impairment;"Speech and language impairments may affect a person’s ability to communicate verbally, with written language or both. Assistive devices such as communication boards are often used by individuals with severe speech or language impairments. Keep the following tips in mind when providing first aid to an individual with a speech or language impairment: If possible, ask questions that can be answered with ""Yes"" or ""No."" Give the person time to communicate and answer your questions. Wait for the person to finish speaking and do not try to finish his or her sentences."
The definition of Choking;The airway is the passage that connects the nose and mouth with the lungs. Choking occurs when the airway becomes partially or completely blocked by a foreign object (e.g., a piece of food or a small toy), by swelling in the mouth or throat, or by fluids, such as vomit or blood. If the airway is blocked by the person’s tongue or by swelling, this is called an anatomical obstruction. If it is blocked by a physical object, this is called a mechanical obstruction. Children younger than 5 years old have a particularly high risk of choking because their airways are about the size of their little fingers, but a person of any age can choke.
Anatomy and Physiology of Choking;The respiratory system consists of the airway and the lungs. When breathing in, air moves from the outside world into the lungs through the airway. The respiratory system constantly supplies the body with the oxygen it needs and removes carbon dioxide. The process is largely involuntary and is controlled by the brain.
Partial Choking;Partial choking happens when the airway is partially blocked. Coughing is the body’s way of clearing the airway, and so it may indicate a partial airway obstruction. A person who is coughing is still able to breathe. Since forceful coughing usually eliminates the obstruction, encourage the person to keep coughing. Stand by and monitor the person in case further help becomes necessary. Note that the care for complete choking 41 will be ineffective for partial choking, because it depends on creating pressure behind the blockage (which is impossible unless the blockage is complete). If the person is or becomes too weak to cough, his or her condition will quickly deteriorate into complete choking. If a choking person is unable to cough forcefully for any reason, call EMS immediately and monitor the person’s condition closely. Typical signs of partial choking include the following: A look of panic, with wide eyes. Forceful or weak coughing. One or both hands clutching the throat. It is not usually necessary to call for help for partial choking, though you may need to do so if the obstruction does not clear or the person’s condition worsens.
Complete Choking;Complete choking happens when the airway is completely blocked. When a person is experiencing complete choking, he or she is unable to breathe and is in a life-threatening situation. Immediate first aid (and possibly medical intervention) is required to remove whatever is blocking the airway. The signs and symptoms of complete choking include the following: An inability to speak, cough, or breathe. High-pitched squeaking noises. Flushed (red) skin that becomes bluish or paler than normal. A look of panic with wide eyes. One or both hands clutching the throat. 
Common Causes of Choking ;Any medical condition that affects a person’s ability to chew and/or swallow increases his or her risk of choking. So can dental problems or poorly fitting dentures that affect a person’s ability to chew food properly. Common causes of choking include the following: Trying to swallow large pieces of food. Eating while talking, laughing, walking, or running. Eating too quickly. 
Prevention from Choking ;The following may reduce the risk of choking in adults: Chewing food well before swallowing, Eating slowly and calmly, Avoiding talking, laughing, walking, and other kinds of physical activity while chewing The following may reduce the risk of choking in children and babies: , When babies start eating solid food, begin with purées as opposed to solid pieces. Always supervise children and babies when they are eating. , Teach children to eat calmly, chew properly, and not to speak with a mouthful of food. Encourage children to sit while eating. , Make sure that babies and young children cannot reach objects small enough for them to swallow. Remember that children can choke on soft plastic (the cut-off corners of milk bags) and rubber (burst balloons) as well as hard objects, so keep these items out of reach.
Care for Partial Choking ;1. If the person is coughing or can speak, encourage him or her to cough forcefully, and do not interfere. Forceful coughing may be enough to clear the obstruction on its own. 2. Encourage or assist the person to sit upright, if possible, as this will make coughing easier and more effective. 3. Continue to monitor the person’s condition until either the obstruction clears itself or the person’s condition worsens. 
Care for Complete Choking ;If possible, send someone to call EMS and get an AED while you care for the person. If you are alone, immediately begin providing care for complete choking. Shout for help to try to attract the attention of a bystander, but do not delay care by calling EMS yourself. Try to dislodge the object by combining any two of the following three options: back blows, abdominal thrusts, and chest thrusts. Continue alternating between the two methods until the object comes out, the person begins to breathe, or the person becomes unresponsive. You may need to adapt which combination of the methods you use depending on the specific circumstances. For example, if the person is pregnant, or you cannot fully reach around the person, you will not be able to provide abdominal thrusts and will therefore have to do a combination of back blows and chest thrusts.
Back Blows;Back Blows is used to deal with complete choking. These are the following steps: 1. Stand behind the person (or kneel, if you are significantly taller) and wrap one arm diagonally across the person’s chest. 2. Bend the person forward at the waist until the upper airway is at least parallel to the ground. 3. With the heel of your free hand, deliver up to 5 firm back blows between the shoulder blades.
Abdominal Thrusts;1. Stand behind the person and ensure that your stance is stable. If the person is much shorter than you are, it may be more effective to kneel. 2. Wrap your arms around the person’s waist, make a fist, and place it just above the belly button. 3. Cover your fist with your other hand and give up to 5 quick, inward and upward thrusts into the person’s abdomen.
Chest Thrusts;1. Stand behind the person (or kneel, if you are significantly taller) and wrap both of your arms around the person’s chest, just under the armpits. 2. Make a fist and place it in the middle of the person’s chest, with your thumb facing inward, and place your other hand over your fist. 3. Give up to 5 chest thrusts by pulling straight back toward you. If you find your thrusts are not effective, pull more sharply and deeply. 
Special Choking Circumstances Larger or Pregnant Responsive, Choking Adult;1. If you cannot reach far enough around a person to perform abdominal thrusts, or if you are aiding a woman who is obviously pregnant, alternate between 5 firm back blows and 5 chest thrusts. 2. Continue until the object comes out, the person begins to breathe or cough, or the person becomes unresponsive.
If You Are By Yourself and Choking;1. Dial EMS and leave the phone off the hook. This will tell the dispatcher to send help. 2. If there are people nearby, move to a place where you can be noticed. 3. Attempt to dislodge the object by performing an abdominal thrust against a safe object with no sharp edges or corners, such as the back of a chair or the edge of a table.
Responsive, Choking Toddler;1. If the child is short enough, kneel on the floor with one knee raised. 2. Perform 5 back blows with the child leaning across your raised leg, alternating with either 5 chest thrusts or 5 abdominal thrusts. 3. Continue until the object comes out, the child begins to breathe or cough, or the child becomes unresponsive.
Choking Baby that less than 12 months;1. Sit or kneel holding the baby. 2. Position the baby face down along your forearm, holding his or her jaw in your hand. 3. Rest your forearm on your leg so that the baby’s head is lower than his or her body. 4. Deliver 5 firm back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your free hand. 5. If the object has not been dislodged, turn the baby face-up, ensuring you support the head. 6. Place 2 fingers on the middle of the chest just below the nipple line and quickly deliver 5 firm chest compressions, pushing down 1/3 of the chest’s depth. 7. Repeat the 5 firm back blows and 5 chest compressions until the object is coughed up, the baby starts to cry, breathe, or cough, or the baby becomes unresponsive.
After the Object Comes Out;An object lodged in the airway can cause damage to the sensitive tissues in the trachea and the back of the throat. This can cause bleeding and swelling. Any person who has suffered complete choking should always seek medical attention, even if the object comes out. If you have done back blows, abdominal thrusts, or chest thrusts, those procedures may have caused damage (in addition to the damage caused by the choking itself), so any person given this care should be assessed in a hospital. A person who has experienced partial choking should seek medical attention if he or she experiences any kind of respiratory distress after the incident. The person should be monitored for several hours after the incident to ensure that there is no damage: if there is no sign of injury in the first few hours, the person is probably fine.
Unresponsive Choking;If the choking person becomes unresponsive, lower him or her to the ground as safely as possible and immediately begin CPR, starting with chest compressions.
Circulation Emergencies;Circulation emergencies are sudden illnesses or injuries involving the heart or the blood vessels. Because every minute counts when a person is experiencing a circulation emergency, the person’s survival often depends on First Aiders acting quickly and giving appropriate care until EMS personnel arrive and take over.
Cardiovascular Disease;Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. It is one of the leading causes of death in Canadians, and it is the underlying cause of many circulation emergencies. Although a circulation emergency such as angina, a heart attack, or a stroke can occur suddenly, the underlying cardiovascular disease often develops over a long period of time. In fact, it can begin as early as the teenage years. Cardiovascular disease occurs when the arteries become hardened and narrowed—a process called atherosclerosis. This damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner artery walls. As this buildup worsens, the arteries become narrower, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through them. The narrowing of arteries increases the risk of artery blockages, which can cause angina, heart attacks, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and strokes.
Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases;Prevention Cardiovascular disease has both controllable and uncontrollable factors. Uncontrollable factors include age, sex, family history, and ethnicity. Fortunately, many risk factors of cardiovascular disease are the result of lifestyle choices and are therefore within a person’s control.
Factors of cardiovascular disease;"Smoking Smoking is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, but it is also one of the most controllable factors. Smokers have a risk of sudden death that is 2 to 4 times greater than that of nonsmokers. Second-hand and smokeless tobacco also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, the risk starts to drop as soon as a person stops smoking. Compared to a smoker, the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases by half within 1 year of quitting smoking. Within 15 years, the risk is close to that of a non-smoker. Many effective community programs are available for individuals who wish to quit smoking permanently. Cholesterol Cholesterol is produced naturally in the body, and is necessary for cellular function. However, not all cholesterol is good for you: low density lipoproteins (LDL, or ""bad cholesterol"") can build up in the bloodstream and stick to the blood vessel walls, narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow. It is easy to measure cholesterol with a blood test. Cholesterol can be controlled with a proper diet and exercise, along with medication if necessary. Blood Pressure High blood pressure can stress and weaken blood vessels throughout the body, and it can contribute to the narrowing of blood vessels. High blood pressure can be hard to detect, so testing for it should be a routine examination. High blood pressure can be controlled with exercise, diet control, stress reduction, and medication. Weight Obesity directly contributes to heart disease. Middle-aged people who are significantly overweight have 3 times the risk of a fatal heart attack when compared to people who are at a healthy weight. Obesity also increases the risk of high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Maintaining a healthy weight requires exercise and a balanced diet. Stress Stress is a normal part of life. Learning to cope with it well helps you to stay healthy and reduces your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, among other illnesses. Stress can be reduced by developing rewarding hobbies and exercising regularly. It can also be helpful to set realistic goals, practice relaxation exercises, and avoid caffeine, which can reduce your ability to handle stress."
Signs of a Heart Attack;"A heart attack occurs when the heart muscle cannot get enough oxygen because of a blockage in one of the arteries that feeds it. The signs and symptoms of a heart attack vary from person to person, and can be different in women and men. Even a person who has had a heart attack before may not experience the same signs and symptoms if he or she has a second heart attack. A person who is having a heart attack may experience chest pain, which can range from mild to unbearable. The person may complain of pressure, squeezing, tightness, aching, or heaviness in the chest. The pain or discomfort is persistent, lasting longer than 3 to 5 minutes. It is not relieved by resting, changing position, or taking medication. It may be difficult to distinguish the pain of a heart attack from the pain of indigestion, heartburn, or a muscle spasm. Other signs and symptoms of a heart attack include the following: Discomfort or pain that spreads to one or both arms, the jaw, the shoulder, the neck, or (more commonly in women) the back or the upper part of the stomach; Problems breathing (e.g., noisy breathing, shortness of breath, or breathing that is faster than normal); Cold, sweaty skin; Skin, lips, and fingers that are bluish, ashen (grey), or paler than normal; Feelings of anxiety, denial, or impending doom;"
Soft Signs of a Heart Attack;During a heart attack, many females, elderly people, and people with diabetes tend to experience soft signs, which are milder or more generalised than the classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack. These soft signs may be experienced for hours, days, or even weeks prior to the heart attack and are often dismissed as nothing out of the ordinary. Soft signs include: Mild, unfocused chest discomfort that: Comes and goes. Does not necessarily feel painful. Gets better with rest and worse with activity, or gets progressively worse. Extreme fatigue (tiredness). Gastric discomfort, nausea, or vomiting. Flu-like symptoms. Dizziness or light-headedness. 
Care for Heart Attack ;1. Have the person rest comfortably. 2. If acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is available, encourage the person to chew 160 to 325 mg (either 1 adult-dose or 2 low-dose ASA tablets), unless the person has an allergy or a contraindication to ASA, such as a bleeding disorder. Ensure that the person thoroughly chews and swallows the ASA. Do not repeat the dosage. 3. If the person takes a prescribed medication to relieve chest pain (nitroglycerin), offer to locate the medication and help the person to take it. If the person has nitroglycerin in a spray or pill form, ensure that the person sprays or places the nitroglycerin under his or her tongue. 4. Reassure the person. Anxiety may increase the person’s discomfort. Other painkilling medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) do not have the same effect as ASA in reducing damage due to heart attacks. Do not substitute ASA with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If given in conjunction with nitroglycerin, erectile dysfunction drugs can cause blood pressure to lower to a life-threatening level. If the person has recently taken an erectile dysfunction drug (in the previous 24 to 48 hours), advise the person not to take nitroglycerin.
Angina;"Angina occurs when the heart requires more oxygen than it is receiving. This occurs when two factors are combined: 1) the arteries are narrowed by cardiovascular disease, reducing blood flow; and 2) the heart’s oxygen needs are elevated (e.g., during times of physical activity or emotional stress). Angina causes a painful squeezing, suffocating, or burning feeling in the chest. Uncontrolled high blood pressure, anemia, and certain heart disorders can all contribute to a person’s risk of angina. The signs and symptoms of angina are similar to the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, but the pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress, goes away if the person rests, and is often relieved by medication (e.g., nitroglycerin). Because it is not possible for First Aiders to distinguish between angina and a heart attack, you should treat a person with angina as you would treat a person having a heart attack."
Stroke;A stroke happens when the blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted, resulting in the death of brain cells. Strokes can cause permanent brain damage, but with quick action, the damage can sometimes be stopped or reversed. Although strokes are most common in older adults, a person of any age, even a child, can have a stroke.
Causes of Stroke;Ruptured Aneurysm A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a brain aneurysm ruptures. A brain aneurysm is a swollen, fragile section in the wall of an artery that carries blood to the brain. When it ruptures, it causes bleeding in the surrounding brain tissues, killing the nearby brain cells and causing a stroke. As an intact brain aneurysm usually has no signs or symptoms, it can go undetected. However, an unruptured brain aneurysm may press against areas in the brain and, depending on the severity of the aneurysm and its location, it can cause signs and symptoms such as neck pain, acute headaches, blurred vision, and changes in speech. Blood Clot An ischemic stroke occurs when a clot becomes lodged in an artery of the brain, usually because the artery has been narrowed by cardiovascular disease. The blockage prevents blood from reaching the brain cells it usually supplies. Brain Tumour A stroke can also occur when a tumour in the brain presses on an artery. The tumour has a similar effect to a blood clot, resulting in decreased blood flow or a complete blockage of blood flow to part of the brain.
Prevention from Stroke;Because the risk factors for stroke are similar to those for heart disease, the risk of a stroke can be reduced by following the same lifestyle changes discussed for preventing cardiovascular disease.
Signs of Stroke;"The signs and symptoms of strokes can vary from person to person. A person who is having a stroke may suddenly develop one or more of the following signs and symptoms: A sudden, severe headache, Dizziness or confusion, Unresponsiveness or temporary loss of responsiveness, Sudden loss of bladder or bowel control. When trying to determine if a person is having a stroke, remember the acronym FAST: Facial numbness or F weakness, especially on one side. Arm numbness or weakness, especially on one side. Abnormal speech, difficulty speaking or understanding others, or a loss of speech. Time is important; call EMS/9-1-1 immediately."
Care for Stroke ;"1. Have the person rest in a comfortable position. If the person prefers to lie down, or is unresponsive, drooling, or having trouble swallowing, place the person in the recovery position. 2. Note when the signs and symptoms first started (or, if you do not know when the signs and symptoms started, note the last time the person was known to be well). 3. Monitor the person’s condition and provide reassurance until EMS personnel arrive; a stroke can be an extremely frightening experience."
Transient Ischemic Attack;"A transient ischemic attack or TIA is also referred to as a ""mini-stroke"" and is caused by a temporary drop in blood flow to part of the brain. A TIA may be caused by a tumour or a clot in an artery in the brain. The signs and symptoms of a TIA are the same as the signs and symptoms of a stroke, but they disappear within a few minutes or hours. A person who has had a TIA is at a very high risk of having a stroke in the near future. In fact, more than 10% of people who have a TIA will have a stroke within 3 months, with half of these strokes happening within 48 hours of the TIA."
Life-Threatening Bleeding;Life-threatening bleeding refers to a situation where large amounts of blood loss occur either externally (outside the body) or internally (within the body). Life-threatening bleeding can occur whenever one or more of the body’s blood vessels are broken. It must be controlled immediately. Bleeding from arteries (arterial bleeding) is often rapid and profuse, and it is always life-threatening. This is because arterial blood is under direct pressure from the heart, so it usually spurts from the wound, making it difficult for clots to form. As a result, arterial bleeding is harder to control than bleeding from veins and capillaries. Veins are damaged more often than arteries because they are closer to the skin’s surface. Bleeding from veins (venous bleeding) is easier to control than arterial bleeding. Venous blood is under less pressure than arterial blood and flows from the wound at a steady rate without spurting. Only damage to veins deep in the body, such as those in the torso or thigh, produces profuse bleeding that is hard to control.
Prevention from Life-Threatening Bleeding;The following precautions may reduce the likelihood of an injury that causes life-threatening bleeding: Be familiar with your surroundings. Keep all sharp objects, such as knives, in a safe place. Get proper training on machinery in the workplace. Always follow the outlined safety procedures when operating equipment. Wear and use appropriate safety equipment at work and at home. Only use equipment for its intended purpose. Stay alert when operating equipment.
Signs of a Life-Threatening External Bleeding;"The signs and symptoms of life-threatening external bleeding include: Blood spurting or flowing freely from a wound; Blood that fails to clot after you have taken all measures to control bleeding; Large amounts of blood loss;"
Care for Life-Threatening External Bleeding;1. Expose the wound. 2. Apply firm and direct pressure to the wound. 3. While maintaining direct pressure, apply a dressing and bandage, and then secure them in place. 4. Reassess the wound to see if the pressure has stopped the bleeding. If not, consider using a tourniquet if the wound is on a limb.
Using a Tourniquet in Bleeding ;A tourniquet is a tight band placed around an extremity (an arm or leg). It constricts blood vessels to stop life-threatening bleeding in circumstances where normal bleeding control is impossible or ineffective. Tourniquets are commercially made, but they can also be improvised with any wide strip of material (e.g., a triangular bandage). If you find yourself in a situation where you need to apply a tourniquet, a commercially manufactured tourniquet is preferred over an improvised device. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for applying the tourniquet. Although tourniquets may have slightly different designs, all are applied in generally the same way. Once a tourniquet is in place, you should not remove it for any reason. Using a tourniquet involves a level of risk, which must be balanced against the potential benefits. You should only apply a tourniquet in the following situations: The person has life-threatening external bleeding that cannot be controlled using direct pressure. The person is in a physical location that makes it impossible to apply direct pressure (e.g., the person or the person’s injured limb is trapped in a confined space). You must move the person and are unable to maintain direct pressure while doing so. 1. Apply the tourniquet 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in.) above the injury. If there is a joint in this range, apply the tourniquet above it, at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) away from the joint. 2. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops. 3. Secure the tourniquet in place. 4. Document the time the tourniquet was tightened.
Using Hemostatic Dressings;A hemostatic dressing is a dressing treated with a substance that speeds clot formation. As is the case with tourniquets, hemostatic dressings are used in cases of life-threatening bleeding where standard first aid procedures fail or are not practical. Typically, hemostatic dressings are used on parts of the body where a tourniquet cannot be applied, such as the neck or torso. A hemostatic dressing can also be used to control bleeding from an open wound on an arm or a leg if a tourniquet is ineffective. The hemostatic dressing is applied at the site of the bleeding (possibly inside the wound) and is used along with direct pressure.
Life-Threatening Internal Bleeding;"Internal bleeding is the escape of blood from arteries, veins, or capillaries into spaces in the body. Life-threatening internal bleeding usually occurs in injuries caused by a violent blunt force, such as when someone falls from a height. You should suspect internal bleeding after any injury that involved a forceful blow to the body. Internal bleeding may also occur when a sharp object, such as a knife, penetrates the skin and damages internal structures. Signs and symptoms of life-threatening internal bleeding include the following: Bruising in the injured area; Soft tissues (e.g., the abdomen) that are tender, swollen, or hard; Blood in saliva or vomit; Pain; Severe thirst, nausea, and vomiting; Anxiety."
What to do in case of Internal Bleeding ;Call EMS and get an AED. You cannot provide first aid for life-threatening internal bleeding as a First Aider. Life-threatening internal bleeding, especially if it results from damage to an organ, requires in hospital medical intervention. Help the injured person rest in the most comfortable position and provide continual care while waiting for EMS personnel. A person with life-threatening internal bleeding may be very thirsty, but giving anything by mouth (even water) can cause serious complications.
Cardiac Arrest;Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. Under normal circumstances, a network of special cells in the heart muscle conducts electrical impulses that coordinate contractions, causing the heart to beat rhythmically. In cardiac arrest, the electrical impulses become abnormal and chaotic. This causes the heart to lose the ability to beat rhythmically, or to stop beating altogether. The respiratory and circulatory systems are very closely linked. After breathing stops, it is not long before the heart stops. This is especially true in children: pediatric cardiac arrests are often the result of airway or breathing emergencies.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest;"Cardiac arrest can happen suddenly and without any warning signs; this is called sudden cardiac arrest. People who have a history of cardiovascular disease or a congenital heart disorder are at higher risk for sudden cardiac arrest. However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for the condition. A person who experiences sudden cardiac arrest is unlikely to survive without immediate care."
Clinical and Biological Death;"Clinical death occurs when breathing stops and the heart stops beating. A person without a heartbeat is clinically dead. Because permanent brain damage does not begin for 4 to 6 minutes, clinical death is reversible with immediate care and intervention. Biological death occurs when the brain becomes irreversibly damaged, which occurs after about 8 to 10 minutes without oxygen. This is also called ""brain death."""
Common Causes of Cardiac Arrest;Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. Other common causes include the following: Drowning, Severe blood loss, Suffocation or complete choking, Electrocution, Drug overdose, Severe chest injuries, Commotio cordis, Other heart diseases and abnormalities Cardiovascular disease and certain congenital heart conditions (i.e., conditions that a person is born with) can increase the risk of cardiac arrest. Breathing emergencies can also lead to cardiac arrest. For example, choking or drowning can interrupt the body’s supply of oxygen, causing the heart to stop beating. Every organ in the body needs a steady supply of oxygen in order to work properly, and the heart is no exception. Severe trauma, electrical shocks, and drug overdoses are other potential causes of cardiac arrest. Although cardiac arrest is more common in adults, it does occur in young people as well. The most common causes of cardiac arrest in children and babies are breathing emergencies, congenital heart disorders, and trauma. Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition, so starting CPR is the top priority. A person in cardiac arrest may have other conditions as well, such as a possible head, neck, or spinal injury, but caring for other injuries is lower priority than starting CPR and getting an AED. When a person experiences cardiac arrest, signs and symptoms may include the following: The person suddenly collapses. The person is unresponsive and not breathing, or is unresponsive with agonal breaths.
What to do in case of Cardiac Arrest;1. Place both of your hands on the centre of the person’s chest. 2. Do 30 compressions: Push down at least 5 cm (about 2 in.), pushing deeply and steadily. Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression (do not lean on the chest). The chest compression rate should be between 100 and 120 beats per minute (30 compressions in 15 to 18 seconds). 3. Give 2 rescue breaths: Open the airway by doing a head-tilt/chin-lift. Place your barrier device over the person’s mouth and nose. If using a plastic face shield, seal your lips tightly over the person’s mouth and pinch the nose. If using a face mask, ensure it is fitted tightly over the mouth and nose. Give 2 rescue breaths. Each breath should last 1 second, with just enough volume to make the chest start to rise. 4. If both breaths go in, repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths. Do 30 compressions: Put 2 hands on the centre of the child’s chest. Push down at least 1/3 of the chest’s depth, pushing deeply and steadily. The chest compression rate should be between 100 and 120 beats per minute (30 compressions in 15 to 18 seconds). Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression (do not lean on the chest). 2. Give 2 breaths: Open the airway by doing a head-tilt or chin-lift. Place your barrier device over the child’s mouth and nose. If using a plastic face shield, seal your lips tightly over the child’s mouth and pinch the nose. If using a face mask, ensure it is fitted tightly over the mouth and nose. Give 2 breaths. Each breath should last 1 second, with just enough volume to make the chest start to rise. 3. If both breaths go in, repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths.
Cardiac Arrest, Baby that less Than 12 Months. What to Do?;1. Do 30 compressions: Put 2 fingers on the middle of the baby’s chest, just below the nipple line. Push down at least 1/3 of the chest’s depth, pushing deep and pushing steady. The chest compression rate should be between 100 and 120 beats per minute (30 compressions in 15 to 18 seconds). Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression (do not lean on the chest). 2. Give 2 breaths: Open the airway by doing a head-tilt/chin-lift. Place your barrier device over the baby’s mouth and nose. If using a plastic face shield, seal your lips tightly over the baby’s mouth and nose. If using a face mask, ensure it is fitted tightly over the mouth and nose. Give 2 breaths. Each breath should last 1 second, with just enough volume to make the chest start to rise. 3. If both breaths go in, repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths. Once you begin CPR, continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths until: EMS personnel take over. An AED is available and there is no one else who can apply the pads to the person’s chest. Another trained First Aider is available and can take over compressions. You have performed approximately 2 minutes of CPR for a child or baby (5 sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths) and you need to call EMS. You are alone and too tired to continue. The scene becomes unsafe. You notice an obvious sign of life, such as movement. If the person shows an obvious sign of life, stop CPR and check the person’s ABCs. If the person is breathing, place him or her in the recovery position, and continue to monitor the person’s condition until EMS personnel take over. 
What to do if the chest does not rise after the first breath;1. Reposition the head to adjust the airway, and attempt to give another breath. 2. If the second breath does not go in, begin the CPR sequence again (30 chest compressions). 3. After the 30 chest compressions, look in the person’s mouth. If you see an object, carefully remove it: With one hand, grasp the lower jaw and tongue (if possible) while opening the mouth. Place one finger from your other hand into the side of the person’s mouth, then sweep behind the object to lift it out. 4. After looking in the mouth (even if nothing is visible) open the airway and attempt to give a breath: If the breath goes in, give a second breath. If the breath does not go in, resume the CPR sequence (starting with 30 chest compressions). 5. Continue to give CPR. After each set of compressions and before attempting to give rescue breaths, look for an object in the person’s mouth and remove it if possible.
Compression-Only CPR;Compression-only CPR uses chest compressions (without rescue breaths) to pump the heart and circulate oxygen that is already in the person’s body. If you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths for any reason (e.g., you do not have a barrier device or the ill or injured person has facial trauma), compression-only CPR is acceptable. As a minimum, you should always perform compression-only CPR for any person in cardiac arrest. You are encouraged to perform traditional CPR (compressions with rescue breaths) whenever possible. Compression-only CPR is always better than no care, and can be effective. However, if you are caring for a child, a baby, or any person who entered cardiac arrest because of a respiratory problem (e.g., choking, drowning, anaphylaxis, asphyxiation), the person may not have much oxygen remaining in his or her blood, and circulating deoxygenated blood is not very useful. In these circumstances, traditional CPR with rescue breaths is the recommended method of care.
CPR Compression Depth for an Adult;When providing CPR to an adult, you should perform compressions in the middle of the chest on the lower half of the sternum. Push deeply and push steadily, ensuring a compression depth of at least 5 cm (about 2 in.), while avoiding excessive depths greater than 6 cm (about 2.5 in.). While there is a risk of injury with compression depths greater than 6 cm, these injuries tend to be non-life-threatening. It is more important to push deeply and push steadily than to worry about pushing too deeply.
CPR Compression Depth for a Child or a Baby;Because of the variation in size among children or babies, compression depth for this age group is measured as a fraction of the total chest depth, not in centimetres. When providing CPR to a child or baby (i.e., a person who has not yet reached puberty), you should perform chest compressions on the lower half of the sternum and depress the chest to at least 1/3 of its depth. Ideally, chest compressions should be at the upper limit of 1/2 of the front-to-back (anteroposterior) depth. CPR compression depths may be impacted by items such as heavy clothing (e.g., a winter coat or motorcycle jacket) or sports equipment. You should not delay starting CPR to remove them, but you may have to push harder to ensure that the minimum chest compression depth is reached.
Chest Compression Rates;"First Aiders should perform chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute. Counting out loud as you give compressions can help you to keep a steady, even rhythm that allows time for adequate chest recoil. For compressions one through 12, say ""one and two and three and four and five and…"" up to 12. When you get to 13, say the numbers without saying “and” in between: ""13, 14, 15, 16…"" and so on. Push down as you say the number and come up as you say ""and"" or the second syllable of the number."
Chest Recoil;You should avoid leaning on the person’s chest wall in between compressions. Instead, ensure that the chest recoils fully. It is during recoil that the coronary arteries of the heart are filled with blood and the heart muscle gets oxygen. If you are leaning on the person’s chest between compressions, the coronary arteries will not get sufficient blood flow and heart death can occur. Remember: Compression is for the brain, recoil is for the heart.
CPR for a Pregnant Woman;When performing CPR for a pregnant woman, raising her right hip 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in.) will help blood return to the heart. If a bystander is available (or an appropriate object is within easy reach), ask the person to find a soft object that you can place under the woman’s hip, but do not interrupt or delay starting CPR to find an object yourself.
Air in the Stomach;When giving rescue breaths, it is important to keep the person’s head tilted back and breathe with just enough force to cause the chest to rise. Failing to tilt the head back, giving too much air in one breath, or blowing too forcefully can push air into the person’s stomach instead of into his or her lungs. Air in the stomach can make someone vomit. When an unresponsive person vomits, the stomach contents may get into the lungs—this is called aspiration. Aspiration makes giving rescue breaths more difficult and reduces the person’s chance of successful resuscitation. To prevent aspiration, remember to give breaths only until the chest starts to rise.
Vomiting during CPR procedure;In some situations a person may vomit while you are giving CPR. If this happens: 1. Turn the person onto his or her side, facing you. 2. Quickly wipe the person’s mouth clean. 3. Reposition the person on his or her back and continue with CPR.
Mouth-to-Nose Breathing;Sometimes you cannot seal your mouth over the person’s mouth to give rescue breaths because: The person’s jaw or mouth is injured. The person’s jaw or mouth is shut too tightly to open. Your mouth is too small to cover the person’s mouth. The person has blood coming out of his or her mouth. If this happens, tilt the person’s head as usual using a head-tilt/chin-lift and breathe into the person’s nose. Block or close the mouth with your hand to stop air from escaping.
Mouth-to-Stoma Breathing;Some people have had an operation to remove part of the trachea. They breathe through an opening called a stoma in the front of the neck. Because air passes directly into the trachea through the stoma instead of through the mouth and nose, you should give rescue breaths into the stoma. Block the person’s mouth and nose with your hand to stop air from escaping.
Automated External Defibrillation;"While CPR can help prevent brain damage and death by keeping oxygenated blood moving throughout the body, an automated external defibrillator (AED) can correct the underlying problem for some people who go into sudden cardiac arrest. Two abnormal heart rhythms in particular, ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-tach), can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. In V-fib, the heart muscle quivers weakly (""fibrillates"") instead of contracting strongly. In V-tach, the heart muscle contracts too rapidly (""tachy-"" means ""fast""). Both of these rhythms impair the heart’s ability to pump and circulate blood throughout the body and both are life-threatening. In many cases, an electrical shock delivered by an AED can correct V-fib and V-tach rhythms. The shock disrupts the heart’s electrical activity long enough for it to spontaneously develop an effective rhythm on its own. Using an AED as soon as possible (along with starting CPR immediately) gives the person the best chance of surviving cardiac arrest. Different types of AEDs are available, but all are similar to operate and guide you using visual displays, voice prompts, or both. If your place of employment has an AED on site, know where it is located, how to operate it, and what the procedures around it are (e.g., for reporting its use or replacing its batteries). Also take note of the location of AEDs in public places that you frequent, such as shopping centres, airports, recreation centres, and sports arenas. In more than 80% of all sudden cardiac deaths, the person’s heart rhythm is ""shockable"" (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). In other words, defibrillation could have helped. If the person’s heart has no electrical activity (asystole or flatline), defibrillation won’t help. For each minute that the person has to wait for defibrillation, the chance of survival drops between 7 and 10%."
Using an AED;"1. Open and turn on the AED. 2. Prepare to apply the AED pads: Remove or cut away clothing and undergarments to expose the person’s chest, and move or remove any objects (including jewellery) that could come into contact with the pads. If the person’s chest is wet, dry it using a towel or gauze pad. Dry skin helps the AED pads to stick properly. Small amounts of chest hair will not interfere with pad adhesion. If the person has thick chest hair, shave the areas where the pads will be placed using the razor included with the AED prep kit. 3. Check if the person has an implanted pacemaker: Look on the chest for a small scar and a lump about the size of a matchbox. Apply the AED pads approximately 2.5 cm (1 in.) away from the pacemaker. 4. Apply the AED pads: Use the appropriate size of pads—adult, child, or baby. A child is considered to be between 1 and 8 years old. If child AED pads are unavailable, use adult pads. A baby is considered to be 1 year old or less. If baby AED pads are unavailable, use child or adult pads. Follow the diagrams on the pads to position them correctly on the person. Pads must be placed at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) apart. If there is not enough space on the chest to leave 2.5 cm (1 in.) between the pads, place one pad on the person’s chest (anterior) and one on the person’s back (posterior). 5. Follow the AED’s prompts to ""Analyze Heart Rhythm:"" Most AEDs will begin to analyze the heart rhythm automatically, but some may require you to push an ""analyze"" button to start this process. No one should touch the person while the AED is analyzing the heart rhythm because this could result in a faulty reading. 6. If the AED prompts you to do so, deliver the shock: Stand clear and say ""I’m clear, you’re clear, everybody’s clear."" Ensure that no one is touching the person (as they can be shocked too), then press the ""shock"" button. 7. After a shock is delivered (or if the AED determines that no shock is necessary), immediately resume CPR, starting with compressions. 8. Continue to follow the AED’s automated prompts. The AED will continue to check the heart rhythm every 2 minutes. Listen for prompts from the AED and continue giving CPR and using the AED until you notice an obvious sign of life or EMS personnel arrive. If you notice an obvious sign of life, stop CPR, but leave the AED turned on and the pads in place on the person’s chest. Continue to follow the AED’s prompts."
Breathing Emergencies;A person who is having difficulty breathing is in respiratory distress. A person who is not breathing is in respiratory arrest. Both respiratory distress and respiratory arrest are breathing emergencies. Respiratory distress is especially dangerous in children, as it can quickly lead to cardiac arrest. Any child showing signs of respiratory distress is in a potentially life-threatening situation and must receive immediate care. When a person is experiencing a breathing emergency, the oxygen supply to the person’s body is either greatly reduced or cut off entirely, so it is important to act at once. If breathing stops or is restricted long enough, the person will become unresponsive, the heart will stop beating, and body systems will quickly fail. Brain cells begin to die after 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen. A breathing problem can be identified by watching and listening to the person’s breathing and by asking the person how he or she feels. If a person is having trouble breathing, do not wait to see if his or her condition improves without intervention, but begin providing care immediately.
Respiratory Distress - Common Causes and What to look for;"Respiratory distress may be caused by any of the following: Hyperventilation; Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Pneumonia or bronchitis; An allergic reaction; Anaphylaxis;  A heart attack or heart failure;  Chest trauma;  Poisoning;  A drug overdose;  Electrocution;  Certain mental health conditions (as an example - panic disorders); The following are signs and symptoms of respiratory distress: Shortness of breath or gasping for breath; Trouble speaking in complete sentences (due to difficulty breathing); Wheezing, gurgling, or high-pitched noises , Breathing abnormally quickly or slowly; Unusually deep or shallow breathing; Cool, moist skin; Bluish or ashen (grey) skin; Flushed or pale skin; Feelings of fear; Dizziness or light-headedness;"
Care for Respiratory Distress ;1. If the person carries medication for respiratory distress, offer to help the person take his or her medication. 2. Encourage the person to sit down in a comfortable position (leaning forward may help make breathing easier). 3. Provide reassurance, as this can help reduce anxiety and help the person control his or her breathing. 4. Monitor the person’s condition and provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive.
Common cases of Hyperventilation ;"Hyperventilation is a condition in which a person is breathing much more quickly than usual. This upsets the body’s balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The following are common causes of hyperventilation: Strong emotions such as excitement, fear, or anxiety; Asthma; Injuries, especially injuries to the head; Exercise; Life-threatening bleeding. Prevention - If you tend to hyperventilate due to anxiety, panic, or stress, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises may help. If you hyperventilate due to a diagnosed medical condition, speaking to your doctor will help you learn how to treat or control it. The following are signs and symptoms of hyperventilation: Rapid, shallow breathing; A feeling of suffocating or not getting enough air; Fear, anxiety, or confusion; A feeling of dizziness; Numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes; Muscle contractions, usually in the hands, feet, arms, and legs; "
What to do in case of Hyperventilation;1. Encourage the person to take controlled breaths by breathing in slowly, holding his or her breath for a few seconds, and then gradually exhaling. Myth: If a person is hyperventilating, you should have him or her breathe into a paper bag. This practice is unsafe and not recommended as a way to care for a hyperventilating person. The best way to treat hyperventilation is to encourage the person to take slow, controlled breaths.
Common causes, care and prevention of Asthma ;"Many people have asthma—a chronic illness in which certain substances or conditions (i.e., triggers) cause inflammation and swelling of the bronchioles (i.e., the small tubes at the base of the lungs), making it harder for air to move in and out of the lungs. Asthma is more common in children. People who have asthma usually know what can trigger an attack and take measures to avoid these triggers. Asthma is usually controlled with medication. Asthma can be triggered by: Air pollution or poor air quality (e.g., cigarette smoke); Allergies (e.g., to pollen, food, drugs, insect stings, or animals); Temperature fluctuations, extreme humidity, or extreme dryness; Strong odours (e.g., perfume, cologne, scented cleaning products); Colds and flus;  Physical activity; Respiratory infections;  Stress or anxiety; If you have asthma, the following precautions may help to prevent attacks: Know what triggers your attacks and avoid them if possible. Ensure that prescribed medication is always easily accessible in case of an attack. If a child has asthma: Make sure that anyone who supervises the child knows about the asthma and how to help give medication if necessary. There are two main types of medication used by people with asthma: Long-term control medication and quick-relief (rescue) medication. A person with asthma may take one, both, or neither of them. Both longterm control medications and quick-relief (rescue) medications may be given through an inhaler, through a nebulizer, or orally. Long-term control medications, sometimes called ""preventers,"" are taken regularly, whether or not signs and symptoms of asthma are present. These medications help prevent asthma attacks by reducing inflammation and swelling and by making the bronchioles less sensitive to triggers. Quick-relief (rescue) medications are taken when a person is experiencing an acute asthma attack. These medications are sometimes called ""bronchodilators,"" because they work quickly to relax the muscles that tighten around the bronchioles, opening (dilating) them immediately so that the person can breathe more easily. Even when a person takes steps to manage his or her asthma by avoiding triggers and taking prescribed long-term control medications, he or she may still occasionally experience asthma attacks. The signs and symptoms of an asthma attack include the following: Wheezing or coughing, especially when exhaling; Gasping for air; Shortness of breath (feeling unable to get enough air into the lungs) , Rapid, shallow breathing (or trouble breathing); Anxiety and fear; Tightness in the chest; Tingling in the hands and feet; Sweating; Inability to say more than a few words without pausing to breathe. What to do when dealing with asthma: 1. Eliminate any asthma triggers, if possible. If something in the environment is causing the attack, move the person away from the area if it is safe to do so. 2. Help the person get into a comfortable position and provide reassurance. 3. Help the person to take any prescribed quick-relief asthma medication that he or she has available."
Providing Care for an Asthma Attack: Using an Asthma Action Plan;Using an Inhaler: 1. Rapidly shake the inhaler 3 or 4 times. 2. Remove the cap from the inhaler. 3. Breathe out as much air as possible, away from the inhaler. 4. Bring the inhaler to the mouth. 5. Press the top of the inhaler while taking one slow, full breath. 6. Hold the breath for as long as is comfortable (up to 10 seconds), and then breathe out. Using an Inhaler with a Spacer: 1. Rapidly shake the inhaler 3 or 4 times. 2. Remove the cap from the inhaler. 3. Remove the spacer’s cap (if it has one), and put the inhaler into the spacer. 4. Bring the spacer to the mouth. 5. Press the top of the inhaler once to dispense the medication into the spacer. 6. Take slow, deep breaths, holding each breath for a several seconds (if possible).
Allergic Reactions;Normally, our immune systems help to keep us healthy by fighting off harmful pathogens that can cause disease. In a person with an allergy, however, the immune system can react to normally harmless substances to produce allergic reactions. An allergic reaction occurs in two stages. First, the immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader and produces antibodies that remain on alert for that particular allergen. When the body is exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms. While certain substances are more common as allergens (e.g., peanuts and pollen), almost anything can produce an allergic reaction. The 80 severity of an allergic reaction depends on the person. It can be as minor as a slight irritation or as serious as a life-threatening emergency (anaphylaxis). The signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction depend on the trigger, but they typically involve the airways, skin, sinuses, nasal passages, cardiovascular system, and digestive systems.
Preventing Allergic Reactions in a Child You Are Caring For;"Discuss the allergy with the parent or guardian before you begin caring for the child, and ask at least the following questions: What is your child allergic to? What signs will tell us that your child is having an allergic reaction? What should we do if your child has a reaction? Has the doctor prescribed any allergy medication? For instance, should you give us your child’s epinephrine auto-injector? Make a list of the allergies of each child under your care, and keep it in a location where you can refer to it easily, especially in cooking and food service areas. Be sure to read all the ingredients on all food package labels when preparing and cooking food. Before serving a food that is a common allergen (e.g., eggs, shellfish, milk, nuts), ensure that the parent or guardian has given it to the child at home without causing a reaction. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from mild to very severe and include the following: Runny, itchy, or stuffy nose; Sneezing; Watery, itchy, red, or swollen eyes; Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; A rash or hives (raised, itchy areas of skin); Tingling of the mouth; Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or throat; Coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath; Weakness, dizziness, or confusion;"
Intensive care of Allergic Reactions ;1. Calm and reassure the person. 2. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact with it. 3. Watch the person for signs of increasing distress. 4. If the person uses a medication to control allergic reactions (such as antihistamines), help him or her to take it. Antihistamines: An antihistamine is a medication that counteracts the effects of histamine (a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction). Antihistamines are supplied as pills, capsules, or liquids and are taken by mouth. The person should take the antihistamine according to the medication label and his or her healthcare provider’s instructions.
Anaphylaxis;"Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction. While mild allergic reactions are localised, anaphylaxis is a body-wide reaction and it can cause system-wide inflammation and swelling. In some cases, the air passages swell, making it difficult to breathe. It is important to act quickly when a person is experiencing anaphylaxis, as it can lead to death if it is not cared for immediately. Anything that causes other allergic reactions can also cause anaphylaxis, and the causes vary from one person to another. The most common allergens that trigger anaphylaxis include: Insect stings; Food; Medications; The following steps may help to prevent an anaphylactic incident: Avoid the substances, foods, or insects that cause reactions. Wear a medical identification product and carry the appropriate medication at all times. The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may be similar to the signs and symptoms of a mild allergic reaction, but they are more pronounced. A person experiencing an anaphylactic emergency may develop one or more signs and symptoms within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the allergen. Anaphylaxis can affect a variety of body systems and can present in various ways. If a person exhibits signs and symptoms from two or more of these categories—especially after contact with an allergen—you should provide care for anaphylaxis: Skin (e.g., swelling of the lips, face, neck, ears, and/or hands, a raised, itchy, blotchy rash, flushing, or hives); Breathing (e.g., a feeling of tightness in the chest or throat, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched noises); Alertness (e.g., weakness, dizziness, or unresponsiveness); Stomach (e.g., stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea);"
Intensive care of Anaphylaxis;If the person has an epinephrine auto-injector, help him or her to use it. 2. Provide reassurance and encourage the person to breathe normally. 3. Help the person get into a comfortable position. If the person’s condition does not improve 5 minutes after the initial dose of epinephrine and EMS personnel have not yet arrived, help the person take a second dose, if available. The second dose should be given in the leg that you did not use for the first dose. If responsive, the person may want to take additional medication such as an antihistamine. Using an Epinephrine Auto-Injector: 1. Remove the safety cap. 2. Place the injection tip against the middle third of the outer thigh and push the epinephrine autoinjector firmly against the thigh with a quick motion. A click should be heard. 3. Hold in place as directed, usually for 5 to 10 seconds. 4. Remove the epinephrine auto-injector. Use caution if the needle tip is exposed. 5. Rub the injection site for 30 seconds to help with medication absorption. 6. Make sure the used epinephrine auto-injector is placed in a rigid container and goes with the person to the hospital. 7. Have the person rest quietly until EMS personnel arrive.
Epinephrine;Epinephrine is a drug that slows or stops the effects of anaphylaxis. If a person has a risk of experiencing anaphylaxis, he or she may carry an epinephrine auto-injector (a syringe system that contains a single dose of epinephrine). Different brands of epinephrine auto-injectors may be available, but all work in a similar fashion. Some have audio prompts to guide the user. Different auto-injectors contain difference doses based on the weight of the person (0.15 mg for children weighing between up to 30 kg (66 lb.), and 0.3 mg for children and adults weighing more than 30 kg (66 lb.)). Many healthcare providers advise that people with a known history of anaphylaxis carry at least two doses of epinephrine (two auto-injectors) with them at all times. This is because more than one dose may be needed to stop an anaphylactic reaction. The second dose should be administered if the person is still having signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis 5 minutes after the first dose.
Abdomen;Abdomen: The part of the body below the chest and above the pelvis. It contains the stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, and other organs. Abdominal thrusts: A method to remove a foreign object from the airway. Airway: The pathway that allows air to travel from the mouth and nose to the lungs. Airway obstruction: A blockage in the airway that stops air from reaching the lungs. Allergic reaction: The body’s response to a substance to which it is particularly sensitive. The response can be mild or very severe. Anemia: A condition caused by a lack of red blood cells. Arteries: Large blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Aspiration: Inhaling blood, vomit, saliva, or foreign material into the lungs. Asthma: A chronic illness in which certain substances or conditions (triggers) cause inflammation and swelling of the bronchioles, making breathing difficult. Automated external defibrillator (AED): An electronic device that analyzes the heart’s electrical rhythm and, if necessary, tells the user to deliver a shock to a person in cardiac arrest.
Cuts and Scrapes;There is usually minimal bleeding with cuts and scrapes, but if the wound is bleeding significantly, apply direct pressure until it stops.If possible, rinse the wound for 5 minutes with clean, running tap water.If an antibiotic ointment or cream is available, ask the person if he or she has a sensitivity to any antibiotics, such as penicillin. If not, suggest the person apply it to the wound.Cover the wound with a sterile non-stick dressing and/or bandage. 5. Ensure that the person knows to watch for signs of infection over the next few days.
Puncture Wounds;A puncture wound occurs when a hole in the skin is created by a pointed object, such as nails, pieces of glass, and animal teeth.Puncture wounds may be caused by: Injuries from pointed objects such as nails or pieces of glass  Animal bites.The following may help you to avoid injuries that cause puncture wounds: Stay away from unfamiliar animals. Wear shoes when walking outside.Clean up sharp objects, like glass, right away. Dispose of sharp objects safely (e.g., do not put broken glass directly into a garbage bag, and, if possible, remove nails from objects before putting the objects into a garbage bag).These signs may indicate an injury caused by a puncture wound: Bleeding.Bruising.A hole where the object went through the skin.1. If the wound is bleeding, apply direct pressure until the bleeding stops. 2. Once the bleeding is controlled, wash the wound thoroughly with water. If possible, rinse the wound for 5 minutes with clean, running tap water. 3. Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and/or bandage. 4. Ensure that the person knows to watch for signs of infection over the next few days.
Scalp Injury;When performing a secondary assessment of a person with a suspected scalp injury, check the scalp thoroughly to ensure that you have uncovered the full extent of the injury.1. Put dressings on the wound and have the person hold them in place to control the bleeding.2. Secure the dressings with a bandage. 3. If you feel a dip, a soft area, or pieces of bone:  Treat the injury as a head injury. Put direct pressure on the wound only if the bleeding is life-threatening. Otherwise, try to control the bleeding with pressure on the area around the wound. 4. Provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive.
Infection;An infection occurs when dirt, foreign bodies, or other materials carrying germs get into a wound. Infections can be localized (e.g., in a cut) or systemic (throughout the body). Infections accompanied by nausea, fever, or general malaise are typically systemic, and can be life-threatening.The following general tips help to minimize the risk of infection:Always wash your hands before and after giving first aid. Wear gloves whenever possible if you will be coming into contact with someone’s bodily fluids. Keep your immunizations up to date. If you have been wounded and do not know when your last tetanus shot was, seek medical attention. Keep any wound clean and wash it regularly. Change the dressing and bandages if they become dirty or wet. Use sterile dressings whenever possible. If sterile dressings are unavailable, use the cleanest option possible.Any of the following signs around an injury may indicate an infection:Redness.Red streaks moving away from the wound.Pus.Heat or warmth. Swelling. Tenderness. Excessive itchiness.
Burns;Burns are soft-tissue injuries caused by chemicals, electricity, heat, or radiation.There are different methods of prevention for different types of burns.
Chemical Burns;Chemical burns can be caused by a wet or dry caustic chemical. Use caution with dry caustic chemicals, as they may spread or react if they become wet.The following precautions will help prevent chemical burns: Store chemicals in their original containers. Wear protective gear when handling chemicals. Wash your hands after touching chemicals. Get trained in a hazardous materials training program, such as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS)/ Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Read the label before using a product. Be aware of caustic plants in your area.
Electrical Burns;The following tips will help prevent electrical burns: Keep electrical appliances away from water. If an electrical cord is frayed, fix it or dispose of it. If there are young children in the building, cover electrical outlets. Before approaching a person with a suspected electrical burn, make sure that trained personnel turn off the electrical current.
Burns from Lightning Strikes;The following precautions will help prevent burns from lightning strikes: As soon as a storm is seen or heard, stop swimming or boating and get away from the water, because water conducts electricity. Stay indoors during thunderstorms. A picnic shelter or car (with the windows rolled up) will also provide some protection. If caught outside, stay away from telephone poles and tall trees. Stay off hilltops and try to crouch down in a ravine or valley if shelters are not available nearby. Stay away from things that conduct electricity, such as farm equipment, small metal vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, bicycles, and golf carts), wire fences, clotheslines, metal pipes, and railings.
Thermal Burns;The following precautions will help prevent thermal burns: When cooking on the stove, turn the pot handles in and use only the back burners when possible. Keep the hot water tank temperature at or below 49°C (120°F). Keep children away from heat sources and appliances such as ovens, barbecues, space heaters, woodstoves, candles, and fireplaces. Keep hot drinks out of children’s reach. Thermal burns are caused by heat, hot liquid, steam, or open flames. The care that is required varies by the thickness of the burn, so you should determine the burn’s seriousness before beginning to provide care.
Sunburns;The following precautions will help prevent sunburns: Limit exposure to the sun between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible. Wear light coloured clothing that covers as much of the body as possible. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and apply it 15 to 30 minutes before going outdoors. Reapply sunscreen at least every 2 hours, as well as after being in the water and after sweating.
Care for Sunburns;While the care for all burns is similar, specific care steps can vary depending on the cause of the burn. Care should be taken to monitor for hypothermia when cooling large burns. This is particularly important in children. Cover the person with a blanket if the person complains of feeling cold.
Superficial Burns;Cool the affected area with clean running or standing water for at least 10 minutes. A clean cool or cold (but not freezing) compress can be used as a substitute.
Partial Thickness Burns;What to Look For:Redness. Pain.  Possible swelling. Blisters. Cool the affected area with clean running or standing water for at least 10 minutes. A clean cool or cold (but not freezing) compress can be used as a substitute. 2. Remove jewellery and clothing from the burn site, but do not attempt to move anything that is stuck to the skin. 3. Once it is cool, cover the burn loosely with a dry, sterile dressing, preferably non-stick gauze. 4. Encourage the person to seek medical attention even if it is not necessary to call EMS/9-1-1.
Full Thickness Burns;Redness, Pain (may not be present in the most severely burned areas due to nerve damage), Possible swelling, Blisters, Charred or waxy, white flesh. 
Care for Thickness Burns;1. Stop the burn from worsening by cooling the affected area with clean running or standing water for at least 10 minutes. A clean, cool or cold (but not freezing) compress can be used as a substitute. 2. Remove jewellery and clothing from the burn site, but do not attempt to move anything that is stuck to the skin. 3. Once it is cool, cover the burn loosely with a dry, sterile dressing, preferably non-stick gauze. 4. Have the person lie down until EMS personnel arrive.
Chemical Burns. What to do?;1. Wear protective equipment to avoid being burned yourself. 2. If there are dry chemicals present, brush them off the person’s skin before flushing with water. 3. Flush the affected areas with large amounts of cool running water for at least 15 minutes, or until EMS personnel arrive. Flush the chemicals away from areas of the body that have not been contaminated. 4. Remove any clothing that is wet or that has been contaminated by the chemical. 5. Refer to the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional first aid measures, if it is available.
Electrical Burns;Electrical burns are caused by powerful electrical currents. They are typically caused by a person either touching a live electrical circuit or being struck by lightning. Because electricity and lightning can affect the heart, it is important to monitor the person’s ABCs closely.1. Treat the person as if he or she has a head and/or spinal injury. 2. Look for two burns (the entry and exit points) and care for them as you would care for thermal burns.
Radiation Burns;The most common type of radiation burn is a sunburn, but they can also be caused by exposure to radioactive substances.1. If the burn results from exposure to a radioactive substance, consult the appropriate workplace safety system (e.g., WHMIS) for specific first aid steps. 2. Care for radiation burns as you would care for thermal burns.
Special Considerations When Caring for Burns;Remember the following special considerations when providing care for burns: Don’t use ointments on partial or full thickness burns. Blisters are a natural cooling system. Leave them in place. Touch a burn only with sterile or clean dressings. Do not use absorbent cotton or pull clothes over any burned area. Pay close attention to the person’s airway. Look for signs of burn injuries around the face. If you suspect that the airway or the lungs may be burned, monitor the person’s breathing closely.
Bruises;A bruise is a discoloured area of the skin that is created when blood and other fluids seep into nearby tissues.The following are signs and symptoms of bruising: Discoloured skin (red, purple, black, or blue areas) Swelling Pain. 1. Using ice or another cold source, cool the injured area to help reduce pain and swelling. Place some sort of cloth, towel, or pad between the cold source and the skin to reduce the risk of freezing. 2. Apply the cold source for 20 minutes and then take it off for 20 to 30 minutes. Continue to do this for as long as the person keeps feeling pain.
Splinters;"A splinter (or ""sliver"") is a sharp, thin piece of material that is stuck in the surface of the skin. If the splinter is completely below the skin, encourage the person to seek medical attention rather than attempting to remove it yourself. 1. Gently grab the exposed end of the splinter with tweezers and carefully pull it out. 2. Wash the area with water and apply a bandage."
Nosebleeds;Nosebleeds may be caused by the following: Forceful nose blowing. High blood pressure. Dry weather conditions.Trauma to the nose or head. Bleeding disorders If you know that the bleeding is caused by an object in the nose, refer to the care for foreign objects in the nose.To prevent nosebleeds: Use a humidifier if the air indoors is dry. Wear protective athletic equipment when participating in sports that could cause injuries to the nose. Practice gentle nose blowing. Teach children not to pick their noses.
Care for Nosebleeding;1. Have the person sit with the head slightly forward, pinching the nostrils, for 10 to 15 minutes. If the nosebleed was caused by a severe head injury, do not pinch the nose. 2. Once you have controlled the bleeding, tell the person to avoid rubbing, blowing, or picking his or her nose because this could start the bleeding again. 3. If the person loses responsiveness, place him or her in the recovery position to allow blood to drain from the nose.
Foreign Objects in the Nose;An object in the nose may be visible, and may also cause the following signs and symptoms: Unusual noises when the person breathes through his or her nose.Bleeding.Nose deformity. 
Care for Foreign Objects in the Nose;1. If you can easily see and grasp the object, remove it. 2. If the object cannot be dislodged easily, leave it in place for a medical professional to remove. 3. Prevent the person from attempting to remove the object and from blowing his or her nose.
Knocked-Out Teeth;A tooth can be knocked out by any kind of blow that involves the mouth.The following tips may avoid an injury that results in knocked-out teeth:Wear appropriate equipment when playing sports, such as a mouth guard or face mask. Always wear a seat belt while in the car and do not eat or drink in a moving car. Aside from a tooth that is visibly missing, signs and symptoms of knocked-out teeth include the following: Bleeding (although this is often very minimal) Pain in the mouth.
Care for a person with Knocked-Out Teeth;1. Control any bleeding by having the person bite down on a clean dressing.2. Carefully pick up the tooth by the crown (the whiter part), not the root. 3. Put the tooth in propolis, egg white, coconut water, whole milk, or saline, if available, and keep it with the person. If none of these are available, wrap the tooth in gauze (or a clean cloth) with some of the person’s own saliva. Seal the container and label it with the name of the person, the date, and the time. 4. Get the person to a dentist as soon as possible. The greatest chance for repair is during the first hour after the tooth is knocked out.
Eye Injuries;Eye injuries can have long-term consequences for a person’s vision, so they must always be treated with extreme care. The eye is an extremely sensitive organ: Avoid touching the eye or putting pressure on or around it, as this can cause further damage. Wounds involving the eyelids or eye sockets should also be treated as eye injuries.An eye injury may be caused by the following:Foreign objects or particles in the eye, An impact to the eye,Radiation or burns, Chemicals or other caustic materials.The following may help to prevent an eye injury: Wearing appropriate equipment in the workplace (e.g., safety glasses),Wearing appropriate equipment when playing sports (e.g., wearing a helmet with a visor or face protector when playing hockey). An eye injury may include the following signs or symptoms: Pain and irritation in the eye. Redness of the eye. Difficulty opening the eye. Problems with vision. Watering of the eye. Deformities of the eye.
Care for Eye Injuries;1. Have the person lie on his or her back and keep as still as possible. 2. Stabilize the object with bulky dressings. 3. Cover both eyes with gauze or another light material. 4. Provide comfort and reassurance until EMS personnel arrive.If there is a foreign object in the eye but it is not impaled:1. Try to remove the foreign object by having the person blink several times. The eye will produce tears that may wash out the object. An object that is not touching the eye itself (e.g., in the corner of the eye) may be removed with a moist cotton-tipped applicator. 2. Clean away any dirt around the eye and then gently flush the eye with running water (letting the water run away from the unaffected eye). 3. If these steps do not remove the object, the person should seek medical attention.If there is a chemical or other caustic substance in the eye:1. Gently flush the eye with running water (away from the unaffected eye) for at least 15 minutes, or until EMS personnel arrive.If the eyes were flash burned (e.g., while welding):1. Cover the eyes with a cool, wet cloth. 2. Make sure the person gets medical attention
Ear Injuries;"The following tips can help prevent ear injuries:Wear proper protection when using loud equipment such as lawn mowers and chainsaws. Wear a helmet and other recommended safety gear when participating in sports and physical activities. Cover the ears when there is a risk of foreign objects or substances entering the ear (e.g., wear a swim cap when participating in water activities). An ear injury may be caused by the following: An impact to the head; Cuts or tears to the ear(s); Loud noises; Blast injuries; Foreign objects or substances in the ear. Signs and symptoms of an ear injury include the following: Blood or other fluid coming from within the ear; Hearing problems; Sudden or intense pain in the ear ; Swelling or deformity of the ear."
Care for Ear Injuries;1. If the injury is an external wound, treat it the same way you would treat a wound on any other part of the body.2. If there is a foreign object in the ear but you don’t suspect a head and/or spinal injury, and it looks as if the object can be easily removed: Tilt the head to the affected side, then gently tap the ear to loosen the object. Attempt to grasp the object and pull it out.
Impaled Objects;An impaled object is anything that has penetrated through the skin and is stuck in the tissues below. An object can become impaled when any type of force causes it to penetrate the skin and underlying tissue. An impaled object will be visibly protruding from the person’s body, and may cause the following signs and symptoms: , Shock , Pain , Bleeding
Care for Impaled Objects ;1. Keep the person still and leave the object in place. 2. Expose the object by carefully removing any clothing around it. 3. Check the circulation below the site of the injury. 4. Stabilize the object by using bulky dressings. 5. Use bandages to hold the dressings in place. Wrap the bandages snugly, but not so tightly as to cut off circulation. 6. Once the dressings are secure, recheck circulation below the site of the injury.  7. Make sure the person gets medical attention.
Amputations;An amputation is a complete or partial severing of a body part. Although this causes a lot of damage to the surrounding tissues, bleeding may or may not be severe. To reduce the risk of amputation: Keep hands clear of doors when they are closing. Use caution near train tracks: only cross at designated crossings, and never walk along the tracks. Be extremely careful when on or around any farm machinery, even when it is turned off or not operating. If the body part is still partially connected to the body, put it back into place as best you can and treat the injury as an open wound or fracture.
How to deal with Amputations;"1. Try to control the bleeding with direct pressure. If you are not successful, or you are unable to apply direct pressure, apply a tourniquet.2. Even if the body part has been fully amputated, there is still the possibility that it could be reattached as long as it is cared for properly. Remember to ""protect it, bag it, cool it, tag it:""PROTECT IT: Wrap the amputated part in gauze or a clean cloth.BAG IT: Place the amputated part in a plastic bag.COOL IT: Keep the amputated part cool by placing the bag on ice. Wrap the bag before cooling it so that the body part does not freeze.TAG IT: Label the container with the person’s name, the date, and the time. 3. Make sure the amputated part goes with the injured person to the hospital."
Crush Injuries;A crush injury occurs when there is a great deal of pressure on a part of the body, such as when a body part is squeezed between two heavy objects.If the person is still trapped under the object(s) or between two objects, it is likely that a crush injury has occurred. Other signs and symptoms of a crush injury include the following:Internal bleeding, Shock, Deformity, Pain.
How to deal with  Crush Injuries;1. If the object is restricting the person’s breathing, or the object is crushing the person’s head, neck, chest, or abdomen, remove the object if it can be safely removed. If it is crushing another body part, leave the object where it is until EMS personnel arrive.
How to deal with  Penetrating Chest Injuries;1. Have the person rest in a comfortable position. If the person wants to lie down, help the person into the recovery position with the injured side toward the ground. 2. If the wound is bleeding profusely, applying pressure or gauze dressings may be necessary to stop the bleeding. If bleeding is minor, do not apply pressure or a dressing.To avoid the build-up of air between the chest wall and the lung (tension pneumothorax), air must be able to exit an open chest wound. If you must apply a dressing, ensure that it does not become saturated with blood, as this will prevent air from escaping. If the dressing becomes saturated, it must be changed.
Chest Injuries;Chest injuries can impact the ribs and/or the organs they protect. They can involve open wounds or internal injuries. If ribs are broken, they can penetrate the skin or the lungs, causing additional injury. Injuries to the chest can result in conditions known as pneumothorax (air in the chest) or hemothorax (blood in the chest). 
Pneumothorax;Pneumothorax is a condition in which air enters the chest cavity from the wound site but doesn’t enter the lung. The air in the chest cavity presses against the lung, causing it to collapse.
Hemothorax;Hemothorax is a condition in which blood accumulates in the chest cavity from the wound site but doesn’t get into the lung. Because blood takes up space in the chest cavity, the lung can’t expand effectively.
Penetrating Chest Injuries;"Penetrating chest injuries cause varying degrees of internal and external bleeding. Additionally, if the object penetrates the ribcage, air can pass freely in and out of the chest cavity and the person can no longer breathe normally. This can result in a breathing emergency. The following are signs and symptoms of a penetrating chest injury: Difficulty breathing; Gasping; Bleeding from an open chest wound that may bubble at the injury site; A sucking sound coming from the wound with each breath; Severe pain at the site of the injury; Coughing up blood;"
Blunt Chest Injuries;"A blunt chest injury is caused by a crushing force that does not create a wound in the chest wall. The most common blunt chest injury is a broken rib. Incidents that may result in blunt chest injuries include motor vehicle collisions, falls, and sports injuries. If multiple ribs break in multiple places, this can produce a loose section of the ribcage that does not move normally with the rest of the chest during breathing. This is called flail chest. Normally, the loose section will move in the opposite direction to the rest of the chest. This is called paradoxical movement. Flail chest can also involve the sternum. The signs and symptom of a blunt chest injury include the following: Pain; Deformity or swelling; Guarded, shallow breathing; Bruising at the site"
Care for Blunt Chest Injuries;1. Keep the person as still as possible, as a blow to the chest may have caused head, neck, and/or spinal injuries. 2. Give the person something bulky (such as a towel) to hold against the chest, as this can make it easier to breathe.
Abdominal Wounds;The abdomen is the area immediately under the chest and above the pelvis. It is easily injured because it is not surrounded by bones. The abdomen contains important organs such as the liver, which can be easily damaged. Injuries to the abdomen are more likely to produce lifethreatening internal bleeding. The signs and symptoms of serious abdominal injuries include: Bruising,  Nausea and vomiting (sometimes vomit containing blood),  Pain, tenderness, or a tight feeling in the abdomen,  Distension in the abdomen, Organs possibly protruding from the abdomen.
Care for Abdominal Wounds;1. Do not apply direct pressure or attempt to push organs back into the abdomen. 2. Cover the protruding organs with moist, sterile dressings. 3. Loosely cover the dressings with plastic, if available. 4. Cover the person with a towel or blanket to keep him or her warm.
Blast Injuries;Blast injuries occur when pressure waves generated by an explosion strike and pass through the body’s surfaces. Blasts release large amounts of energy in the form of pressure and heat. Injuries can include loss of hearing, pneumothorax, internal bleeding, and organ damage. Thermal burns may also occur from exposure to heat. The extent of blast injuries may be difficult to identify because sometimes there are no visible external injuries, and indicators of internal injuries may not be apparent. A person with suspected blast injuries should be monitored and reassessed frequently while waiting for EMS personnel to arrive. There are four mechanisms of injury resulting from blasts: 1. Pressure or heat injuries from the blast itself. 2. Injuries from flying debris (shrapnel). 3. Trauma from being thrown by the blast. 4. Injuries or illnesses caused by hazardous material being dispersed by the blast.
Care for Blast Injuries;1. Keep the person still. 2. Treat any obvious external injuries. 3. Constantly monitor the person’s condition as it may change rapidly. 
The Neck and Spine;"The spine is a strong, flexible column of small bones called vertebrae; it supports the head and the torso. The spine surrounds and protects the spinal cord, which is a bundle of nerves that runs between the brain and the lower back. The spine is divided into four regions: 1. The cervical (neck) region, which consists of the C1 to C7 vertebrae. 2. The thoracic (chest) region, which consists of the T1 to T12 vertebrae. 3. The lumbar (lower back) region, which consists of the L1 to L5 vertebrae. 4. The sacrum (hip) and coccyx (tailbone) region, which consists of the S1 to S5 vertebrae and the four fused vertebrae that form the tailbone. Severe injuries can move or break the vertebrae so that they squeeze or cut the spinal cord, causing temporary or permanent paralysis, or even death. Damage can also occur if the injury causes the soft tissue of the spinal cord to swell, compressing it against the hard bone that surrounds it. Depending on the location and severity of the injury, the person may develop paralysis (the loss of movement, sensation or both) in body parts below the injury. Paraplegia is paralysis that affects both legs and the lower trunk. Quadriplegia is paralysis that affects both arms, the torso, and both legs. The higher up the spine the injury occurs, the more extensive the paralysis will be."
The Brain;The brain is the centre of the nervous system. It is the master organ that controls all body functions. The brain has the consistency of gelatin, but it is cushioned from everyday bumps and jolts by the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull. Because the skull is hard, there is not much room for the brain to move or swell. Brain injuries can occur as a result of a blow to the head, a penetrating injury to the head (such as a bullet wound), or exposure to accelerationdeceleration forces that cause the head to snap forward and then back. A blow to the head can lead to a concussion (a traumatic brain injury that alters the way it functions), a brain contusion (bruising of the brain tissue) or a brain hematoma (bleeding into the space between the brain and the skull, which increases the pressure inside the skull and damages brain tissue).
Common symptoms of a head, neck, or spinal injuries;The signs and symptoms of a head, neck, or spinal injury depend on the nature and location of the injury. Bleeding inside the skull can happen slowly, so the signs may take time to appear. The severity of a head, neck, or spinal injury can only be determined through an evaluation by medical personnel: you should always assume that such an injury is serious. The following signs and symptoms alone do not always indicate a serious head, neck, or spinal injury, but you should call EMS/9-1-1 if any of these are present: Changes in level of responsiveness, awareness, and behaviour, Drowsiness, confusion, or disorientation,  Severe pain or pressure in the head, neck, or back, Blood or other fluids in the ears or nose , Heavy external bleeding from the head, neck, or back , Unusual bumps, bruises, or depressions on the head, neck, or back , Seizures , Impaired breathing or vision , Nausea or vomiting , Unequal pupil size , Persistent headache , Partial or complete loss of movement of any body part without an obvious traumatic cause (e.g., inability to move a limb that does not appear to be injured) , Back pain, weakness, tingling, or loss of sensation in the hands, fingers, feet, or toes , Unusually positioned neck or back , Dizziness and/or loss of balance , Bruising of the head, especially around the eyes and behind the ears , Loss of bladder or bowel control , Behaviour similar to that of a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs (e.g., stumbling, memory loss, speech problems)
Prevent from getting a head, neck, or spinal injuries;The following tips help to prevent head, neck, and spinal injuries: , Wear safety belts with shoulder restraints when in a vehicle. , Children and babies should always ride in approved safety seats. Make sure the seat is designed for the child’s age and weight and make sure it is properly installed. , Wear all recommended protective equipment for the activity you are engaged in (e.g., approved bicycle helmets). Never join in a new sport without knowing the rules and risks involved. , Prevent falls around the home and workplace with non-slip floors, non-slip treads on stairs, handrails on staircases, rugs secured with double-sided adhesive tape, and handrails by the bathtub and toilet if necessary. , Make sure that there is good lighting in stairways and hallways. , If there are small children present, put gates at the top and bottom of the stairways. , Make sure that your workplace is clean and tidy. Keep floors and aisles uncluttered and make sure that there is nothing blocking stairways, work sites, or exits. , Drink responsibly. Alcohol is often a factor in serious motor vehicle collisions and water injuries. Alcohol slows down your reflexes and gives you a false feeling of confidence. , Prescription drugs and common drugstore medications can make driving or operating machinery dangerous, so follow the directions on the package carefully. , Check equipment (such as warehouse forklifts, ladders, and scaffolding) regularly for worn or loose parts. , Use ladders carefully and correctly. , Always be very careful around water:Before diving, make sure that the water is deep enough, and check for objects below the surface, such as logs or pilings. Pools at homes, motels, or hotels may not be safe for diving. Enter unknown water feet first. Enter above-ground pools feet first.  When bodysurfing, keep your arms out in front of you to protect your head and neck.
How to deal with head, neck, or spinal injuries;It is imperative that a person with a head, neck, or spinal injury remain as still as possible, unless keeping him or her in the position found would actually put the person’s life at risk (if the scene is becoming unsafe, for example, or if you must roll the person over to put pressure on lifethreatening bleeding). As always, an unresponsive person should be rolled into the recovery position. The risk of further damage to the spine is less serious than the risk of the person’s airway being obstructed. You should take steps to discourage the person from moving reflexively. For example, if the person is lying on the ground, approach from a direction that allows the person to see you without turning his or her head. You should also tell the person to respond verbally to your questions rather than nodding or shaking his or her head. If the person is unresponsive, you must check his or her ABCs, but this can often be done without moving the person. If you can see chest movement or can hear the person moaning, crying, or coughing, that means the person is breathing. Do not attempt to remove a person’s helmet or remove a child from a car seat unless it prevents you from checking the ABCs or providing care for a life-threatening condition.1. Restrict movement of the head, neck, and spine as much as you can until EMS personnel arrive: If the person is responsive, instruct him or her to keep as still as possible. If the person is unable to do so, manually support the head in a position that limits movement. 2. Keep the person in the position he or she was found, unless the person is in immediate danger or has life-threatening conditions that need immediate attention. 3. If blood or other fluid is in the ear canal or draining from the ear: Let the ear drain. Do not apply direct pressure. Do not move the person unless it is absolutely necessary. Cover the ear loosely with a sterile dressing.
When to Move a Person with a Head, Neck, or Spinal Injury;You may need to move a person with a head, neck, and/or spinal injury in the following situations:  The person’s airway is blocked (for example, if the person vomits)  The scene of the emergency becomes dangerous  There is no organized EMS response in the region (for example, if the injury occurs in a very remote area) When moving the person, try to keep the head, neck, and spine in the position you found them. Avoid unnecessary jostling and move the person only as much as is necessary. Remember, it is more important to treat life-threatening conditions than it is to keep the person still. If the person has a potential spinal injury and is not breathing, opening the airway and starting CPR immediately are more important than protecting the spine from further damage.
Concussion;"A concussion is a subset of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that involve a temporary alteration in brain function. An impact to the head or upper body can create forces that cause the brain to ""shake"" inside the skull. This shaking can cause the brain to collide with the bony structures that make up the skull’s inner shell (sometimes causing swelling and/or bleeding), or to rotate within the skull, which can shear or tear the brain nerve fibres and sometimes stretch and damage the brain cells. A concussion can result from even a seemingly minor bump, blow, or jolt, and may be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms may not be immediately obvious. Concussions are evolving injuries, with the effects intensifying, dissipating, or changing unexpectedly in the days and weeks following the event of the injury. Depending on the severity of the concussion, signs and symptoms can last for days, weeks, or even months. The majority of concussions, however, resolve in a short period of time. It is not fully known exactly what happens to brain cells in a concussion, but a change in the brain’s chemical function seems to be involved in the process. As a result, concussions are rarely visible in neuroimaging scans. The exact duration of this altered function is not yet known, but during the recovery period the brain is more susceptible to further injury. A person who has had one concussion is at increased risk for future concussions. As a result, it is critical that as soon as someone is suspected of having a concussion, they are removed from activity and seek care from a qualified medical professional. A person does not need to become unresponsive to have incurred a concussion. A concussion may be caused by:  A blunt force to the head or jaw  An explosion  Whiplash  A forceful blow to the body  Shaking (in the case of a baby)"
Signs ans syptoms of a concussion;"Thinking and Remembering: Confusion  Clouded or foggy mindset  Seeming stunned or dazed  Temporary memory loss regarding the event of the injury  Difficulty concentrating  Difficulty remembering or recalling events  Slowed reaction times. Physical: Neck pain, headache, or pressure within the head  Fatigue, low energy, or feeling ""foggy""  Short-term loss of responsiveness  Dizziness or loss of balance  Double or blurred vision, or ""seeing stars""  Ringing in the ears  Nausea or vomiting  Mumbled or indistinct speech  Sensitivity to light and/or noise  Not feeling “right”  Seizure or convulsion. Emotional:  Irritability  Sadness or depression  Heightened emotions  Nervousness or anxiety  Personality changes. Sleep: Drowsiness  Sleeping more or less than usual  Difficulty sleeping. Concussions are often left untreated because the symptoms are not always recognized by the person who has been injured, and the signs are not always obvious to others. There may also be personal or external pressures to continue participating in the activity at hand (e.g., workplace requirements, social events, or sporting activities), instead of avoiding such aggravating factors. Continued participation in activities that provoke symptoms during either the acute or the recovery stage can reaggravate the condition due to raised levels of exertion. To avoid this, it is important that the person seek medical attention following a blow to the head, neck, or upper body with any concussion symptoms. Cessation of physical activity and the promotion of cognitive rest (reducing ""screen time"" and other activities that require concentration) are critical to the resolution of concussion injuries."
Care for Concussions;If you think a person has sustained a concussion, advise the person to stop the activity he or she was engaged in when the incident occurred. If the person sustains an injury that causes a jolt or blow to the head or body, and then displays any signs and symptoms of a concussion, you should assume that a concussion has occurred. The person should follow up with a qualified healthcare provider as soon as possible for a full evaluation. A healthcare provider is best able to evaluate the severity of the injury and make recommendations about when the person can return to normal activities. While rare, permanent brain damage and death are potential consequences of failing to identify and respond to a concussion in a timely manner. Prompt recognition of when a potential concussion injury has occurred, immediate removal from the activity, and appropriate follow-up care are key elements in preventing catastrophic consequences. Anyone who exhibits more concerning signs and symptoms requires immediate medical evaluation. An injury that causes a concussion may also trigger bleeding in or around the brain, leading to symptoms like extended drowsiness and confusion. This type of bleeding can be lifethreatening. The person must be monitored in the immediate hours after the injury to ensure that the symptoms do not progress or worsen, as this can indicate additional brain injuries that require emergency care.
Follow-Up Care for Concussions;It is important that the person seek medical advice from a doctor, ideally one who specializes in concussions, since signs and symptoms can escalate in the days or weeks following the injury. A person who has suffered a concussion should not participate in any physical activities until a doctor gives permission to do so. Activities that require concentration (e.g., reading) and visual stimulation, such as working on a computer, texting, etc. should also be reduced to allow the brain the opportunity to recover from cognitive stressors. When given permission from a doctor, it is important to resume all of these activities gradually and be monitored by a medical professional. A person recovering from a concussion may not be able to effectively monitor his or her own symptoms, and may not make the best decisions about things like rest, sleep, and limiting visual stimulation. It is crucial that the person’s family members, caregivers, friends, or colleagues note any changes in his or her sleep habits or physical, cognitive, or emotional 115 behaviour, as any of these can indicate that the recovery phase has been compromised. These people can also have a positive impact on concussion recovery by supporting the person and encouraging him or her to follow the concussion recovery plan outlined by the doctor. Proper management of the person’s signs and symptoms by a qualified healthcare provider will help to avoid future problems that may lead to permanent issues and a diminished quality of life. If treated improperly, concussions can cause a wide range of functional long-term changes affecting thinking, sensation, language, and/or emotions. Concussions can also cause long-term neurological conditions, such as seizure disorders, and, in the most severe cases, death.
Shaken Baby Syndrome;Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) refers to a variety of injuries that may result when a baby or a young child is violently shaken. This causes the brain to move within the skull, forcing blood vessels to stretch and tear. SBS is most associated with babies and toddlers, but can occur in children up to 5 years old. SBS is the most common cause of mortality in babies. It is the most frequent cause of long-term disability in babies and young children, and it can cause permanent brain damage. SBS differs from other forms of physical abuse in that it is frequently a single event and there may be no obvious sign of injury. Often there is no intent to harm the baby. Inconsolable crying is the most common trigger that leads a person to shake a baby. When trying to console a crying baby, never shake the baby, no matter what. Instead, place the baby face-up in a safe place and let the baby cry. Take a few deep breaths and then try again to soothe the baby. Other common triggers are feeding problems and difficulties with toilet training. Feelings of anger and frustration can be overwhelming. However, shaking a child or baby is never appropriate. If you feel like you might lose control, stop! Take a break, never shake. Place the child in a safe place and take a time-out for as long as it takes you to feel calm. Talk to someone you trust about your feelings. If you ever feel you may hurt a baby, call for help: a family member, neighbour, or local crisis line can provide emotional support and help you to find a solution. 
Bones;Bones are strong, hard, dense, tissues that come in many different sizes and shapes. More than 200 bones make up the skeleton, creating the framework for the body. Muscles are soft tissues that can contract and relax. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons and move the body when they receive signals from the brain. A joint is formed where two or more bones are held together by ligaments that allow movement. Bones, muscles, and joints have many jobs:  Supporting the body  Protecting internal organs  Allowing movement  Storing minerals  Producing blood cells  Producing heat through movement
Sprain;Occurs when a ligament is stretched, torn, or damaged. Ligaments connect bones together at the joints. Sprains most commonly affect the ankle, knee, wrist, and finger joints.
Strain;Occurs when a tendon or muscle is stretched, torn, or damaged. Tendons connect muscles to bones. Strains are often caused by overworking a muscle (e.g., by lifting an overly heavy object or by repetitively performing the same action). They usually involve the muscles in the neck, back, thigh, or the back of the lower leg.
Dislocation;Occurs when the bones that meet at a joint move out of their normal position. This type of injury is usually caused by a violent force that tears the ligaments, allowing the bones to move out of place.
Fracture;"A complete break, chip, or crack in a bone. Fractures can be open (if the end of the broken bone breaks through the skin) or closed (the broken bone does not break through the skin). Open fractures are also called ""compound fractures."
Muscle Cramps;A muscle cramp is a painful condition that can be caused by heavy exercise or staying in the same position for too long. You can usually stop the pain by stretching and massaging the area with the cramp, resting, or changing position. Bone, muscle, and joint injuries can occur in many ways. The causes include the following:  Falls  Awkward or sudden movements  Direct blows to the body  Repetitive actions or forces, such as jogging
Prevent bone, muscle, and joint injuries;The following tips help prevent bone, muscle, and joint injuries:  Always wear seat belts and shoulder restraints when in a vehicle, and ensure that all passengers do the same.  Secure younger children in approved and properly installed childrestraint systems (e.g., car seats and booster seats).  Wear all safety equipment that is required or recommended (e.g., helmets, goggles, and pads).  Put non-slip adhesive strips or a mat in the bathtub and shower stall.  Stretch before exercising.  Avoid over-exertion and take breaks often. Children should learn their limits and rest when they are too tired or frustrated to continue safely. Falls are the leading cause of injuries among the elderly. Reduce the risk with safety measures such as:  Good lighting.  Sturdy railings on staircases.  Non-slip floors and rugs.
The signs and symptoms of bone, muscle, and joint injuries;The signs and symptoms of bone, muscle, and joint injuries may include the following:  Pain, deformity, swelling, or bruising  Limited or no use of the injured body part  A broken bone or bone fragments sticking out of the skin  A sensation or sound of bones grating  Possible muscle cramps  The sound of a snap or a pop when the injury happened
What to Do in case of bone, muscle, and joint injuries ;The person may be anxious and in a lot of pain. In most cases, the best thing that you can do is keep the person comfortable and prevent further injury until the person receives medical attention. To avoid damaging nerves, blood vessels, and tissues, do not perform traction or any other manipulation. When caring for an open fracture, your first priority is to stop any bleeding. Provide care as you would for any other open wound. Treat the injury using the RICE method: REST — Have the person stop any current activities and rest without moving or straightening the injured body part. IMMOBILIZE — If you need to move the person or if EMS response will be delayed, immobilize the injured area in the position in which it was found by creating a splint. Otherwise keep the person still and do not splint the injury. COOL — If it does not cause the person any discomfort, cool the injured area for 20 minutes of every hour to reduce swelling and pain. The part should be cooled for 20 minutes of every hour for up to 48 hours. Do not rub the ice or cold pack on the injured area. If you use ice, put some sort of thin, dry cloth or pad between it and the person’s bare skin to avoid freezing the skin. ELEVATE — Keep the injured area above the level of the heart, if possible. However, do not raise the injured area if 120 moving it will cause pain.
Splinting Guidelines;Splinting involves securing an injured bone or joint to keep it from moving, which reduces the risk of further injury and helps reduce pain. However, you should apply a splint only if you must move a person to get medical help or if the EMS response will be delayed. Common items such as rolled newspapers, scarves, belts, and pillows can be used to improvise slings and splints if commercial versions are not available. Medical tape and medical braces can also be used to support strains and sprains.
Soft splints;Soft splints are soft, bulky objects (e.g., a folded blanket, towel, pillow, or bandage).
Rigid splints a;Rigid splints are hard, fixed objects (e.g., a board, a rolled newspaper, a tree branch).
Anatomical splints;Anatomical splints use another body part for support (e.g., immobilize an injured leg by securing it to the uninjured leg).
Slings;Slings use cloth looped around the neck to support an upper extremity (e.g., the arm or wrist).
Applying a Splint;No matter what type of splint you use, follow these steps:  Check the temperature and colour of the skin below the injured area before and after splinting. The area should be warm, indicating good circulation. If the area is cold before splinting, call EMS/9-1-1 if you have not already done so.  If the area is warm before splinting and cold afterwards, the splint may be too tight. Loosen it gently, and reassess to see if circulation has been restored.  When possible, splint the injured part in the position in which it was found. Do not try to straighten or move the body part.  Make sure the splint is long enough to extend above and below the injured area:  For bone injuries, immobilize the joint above and below the site of the injury. For joint injuries, immobilize the bones above and below the site of the injury.  If you are not sure what is injured, include both the bones and the joints above and below the injured area in the splint.  Always pad a rigid or anatomical splint to make the person more comfortable.  Remove any jewellery (especially rings) that the person is wearing below the site of the injury, as swelling is likely to occur.
Applying a Regular Sling for an Arm Injury;1. Check the person’s circulation by comparing the warmth and colour of the fingers on the injured side with the other hand, and ask if the person has any numbness or tingling in the fingers. 2. Have the person support the injured arm, holding it across the body. 5. Tie the bandage toward one side of the neck, not at the back, to reduce discomfort from the knot. 6. Secure the elbow by twisting, tying, or pinning the corner of the bandage. 7. Apply a binder (as described below). 3. Slide the open triangular bandage between the injured arm and the body. The corner of the triangular bandage should extend past the elbow. The opposite side (the base of the triangle) should be running vertically, parallel to the edge of the body with the upper point over the shoulder. 4. Take the bottom end of the bandage and place it over the opposite shoulder. 8. Recheck circulation. Slings should fit tightly enough to restrict movement, but not be so tight that blood flow is affected. If fingers are bluish or cold or if the person feels numbness and tingling, loosen the bandages. If loosening the bandages does not improve circulation, call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED immediately.
Applying a Tube Sling;1. Check the person’s circulation by comparing the warmth and colour of the fingers on the injured side with the other hand, and ask if the person has any numbness or tingling in the fingers. 2. Have the person hold the arm of the injured side across the body with the fingers touching the opposite shoulder. 5. Twist the end of the bandage hanging below the elbow several times to secure the arm, then bring it around and up the back to meet the other end of the bandage near the person’s neck. 6. Adjust the height of the sling to make sure it is supporting the arm. 7. Secure the sling by tying the two ends together in the hollow of the neck on the uninjured side. 3. Place the open triangular bandage over the forearm and hand with the base parallel to the body and the opposite point extending past the elbow. 4. Support the forearm and gently tuck the lower edge of the bandage under the arm, from the hand to the elbow. 8. Pad between the arm and the body, in the natural hollow, with soft, firm material. 9. Apply a binder (as described on the following page). 10.Recheck circulation. Slings should fit tightly enough to restrict movement, but not be so tight that blood flow is affected. If fingers are bluish or cold or if the person feels numbness and tingling, loosen the bandages. If loosening the bandages does not improve circulation, call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED immediately.
Applying a Binder for an Arm Injury;A binder is used in addition to a sling and secures a slung upper extremity to the body. This provides additional support by creating anatomical support in addition to the sling. 1. Wrap a broad bandage around the injured arm and the body. 2. Tie the bandage snugly at the uninjured side. 3. Recheck circulation. The binder should fit tightly enough to restrict movement, but not be so tight that blood flow is affected. If fingers are bluish or cold or if the person feels numbness and tingling, loosen the bandages. If loosening the bandages does not improve circulation, call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED immediately.
Osteoporosis;Osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disorder that occurs when the amount of calcium in the bones decreases, causing low bone mass and the deterioration of bone tissue. Normally, bones are hard, dense tissues that can endure tremendous stress. Bone-building cells constantly repair damage that occurs as a result of everyday wear and tear, keeping bones strong. When the calcium content of bones decreases, the bones become frail, less dense, and less able to repair themselves after incurring stress and damage. The loss of density and strength leaves bones more susceptible to fractures (especially of the hips, vertebrae, and wrists). Instead of being caused by tremendous force, fractures may now occur spontaneously, with little or no aggravation, trauma, or force. For example, the person may be taking a walk or washing dishes when the fracture occurs. Some hip fractures thought to be caused by falls are actually spontaneous fractures that cause the person’s fall. Repeated fractures are also a sign of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a leading cause of bone and joint injuries in older people. It is much more common in women, affecting one in four. You can help prevent osteoporosis by:  Building strong bones at an early age.  Making sure to get enough calcium.  Making sure to get enough vitamin D (the body needs vitamin D so that it can absorb calcium).  Exercising regularly.
Mental Health Crisis;Mental health first aid is the initial care given by a First Aider to a person in a mental health crisis. Like any first aid, it includes the recognition of signs and symptoms and the care that can be given until either appropriate professional follow-up care is received or the crisis is resolved. Call Call EMS/9-1-1 for a febrile seizure if:  It is the first time that the child or baby has had a febrile seizure.  The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or is repeated.  The seizure is followed by a quick increase in body temperature. A First Aider is not a therapist, but rather a listener. Your role is to look, listen, and feel empathy for the person’s situation and provide both physical and mental health first aid as necessary. You may also need to refer the person to the appropriate follow-up care, just as you might when caring for physical conditions.
Mental Health Conditions;Mental health conditions are difficult to identify. They may go unrecognized unless the person shares the information with you. People in distress can be suffering from a number of disorders including substance-related disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders or, less commonly, psychotic disorders. A person with a mental health condition may experience one, many, or none of the following symptoms:  Inability to think clearly  Inability to concentrate or focus on a task  Hallucinations (e.g., hearing voices, seeing, or feeling things that aren’t there)  Delusions  Depression or acute mood swings (e.g., from happy to depressed with no clear reason for the change)  Poor memory  Obvious lack of motivation
How to help a person with a mental health crisis;Helping a person through a mental health crisis can be achieved by using active listening practices:  Reduce distractions and encourage the person to sit down to promote conversation.  Keep the person as calm as possible.  Listen empathetically.  Acknowledge the person’s feelings and emotions without judgment.  If the person is delusional, do not dismiss his or her beliefs: accept that they are real to the person (but not to you).  Speak quietly and firmly. 1. Use active listening practices to provide reassurance, comfort, and support. 2. Offer self-help strategies such as breathing exercises.
Self-Inflicted Injuries;Self-harm ranges from minor self-inflicted injuries to suicide. Suicide is one of the ten most common causes of death in Canada, affecting people from a variety of backgrounds and age groups. Anyone expressing intentions of self-harm requires immediate intervention, and therefore EMS/9-1-1 must always be called. Possible indicators of self-harm include the following:  A person expressing negative (especially suicidal) thoughts and comments about him-or herself  A person expressing his or her intent to die, especially if he or she has a plan to do so  A person expressing his or her final wishes to someone close by (e.g., a bystander at scene)  Items associated with a suicide attempt found at the scene (e.g., a gun, sleeping pills)
Childbirth;You may find yourself in the position of helping a pregnant woman who is in labour. Childbirth is a natural process and the woman’s body knows what to do: Your primary role will be to provide comfort and reassurance and to facilitate the process while you wait for EMS personnel to arrive. The labour and delivery process will happen without much intervention on your part. Remember, the woman who is pregnant delivers the baby. Be patient and let the birth happen naturally. 
Signs and symptoms that signal imminent childbirth i;Signs and symptoms that signal imminent childbirth include the following:  Contractions that are 2 minutes apart or less  The woman says that the baby is coming  The woman feels the urge to push  The woman feels like she needs to have a bowel movement  The baby is crowning
Instruction for Childbirth;1. Clear the area of unnecessary bystanders. 2. Help the woman into a position of comfort. 3. Create a clean birthing area by placing clean blankets and/or towels under the woman. For the sake of privacy, place a clean sheet or towel over the woman’s abdomen. 4. As the baby is being birthed:  Support the head as it is delivered. Do not push or pull the baby.  Once the shoulders emerge, the rest of the baby will be delivered very quickly.  Newborns are slippery, so hold the baby firmly but do not squeeze him or her. 5. Position the baby face down and wipe any fluids or mucus away from his or her mouth and nose. 6. Check the baby’s airway and breathing. Babies may not breathe and cry immediately after they are born. Usually, actively drying them with a towel will stimulate them to breathe and cry. If the baby does not begin to breathe or cry following stimulation, begin CPR. 7. Keep the baby warm by placing him or her directly onto the mother’s chest and covering with a blanket or towel, or by wrapping the baby in a clean towel or blanket. 8. Let the placenta and cord drop onto a clean towel and keep this near the baby. Do not cut the cord. Handle the placenta and cord as little as possible. 9. Record the time of birth. 10.If the mother is bleeding, you may need to apply gentle pressure to any bleeding tears. 11. Provide continual care for both the mother and the baby until EMS personnel arrive.
Assisting with Childbirth: What Not to Do;When providing care for a woman during childbirth:  Do not let the woman leave to use the restroom. (The woman could deliver the baby into the toilet, putting the baby at risk for injury.)  Do not try to physically delay delivery, as this can cause serious injuries to both the mother and the baby.  Do not place your fingers in the woman’s vagina for any reason. This can introduce pathogens that can cause an infection.  Do not pull on the baby
Miscarriage;Miscarriage is the spontaneous end of a pregnancy any time during the first 20 weeks after conception. This occurs in about 1 in 10 pregnancies. The risk of miscarriage drops as the pregnancy progresses. There are a number of causes of miscarriage, including the following:  Hormonal or genetic complications  Abnormalities in the womb  Infection and certain illnesses  Trauma. The signs and symptoms of a miscarriage include the following:  Anxiety and apprehensiveness  Vaginal bleeding, which may be minor or profuse  Cramp-like pain that is similar to labour or menstruation. 
Care for Miscarriage;1. If possible, save any tissue from the miscarriage for EMS personnel. 2. Provide comfort and continual care until EMS personnel arrive.
How Body Temperature Is Controlled;The human body’s core temperature (i.e., the temperature of the heart, lungs, and brain) is normally around 37°C (98.6°F) and is maintained by balancing heat loss with heat gain. The body generates heat by either converting food into energy or by contracting muscles (e.g., shivering, exercising). The heat produced by routine activities such as walking is usually enough to balance normal heat loss.
The Hypothalamus and Body Temperature;"The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that controls thermoregulation, which is the body’s ability to maintain a temperature that is within the ideal range. The hypothalamus gets temperature information from the skin and central receptors. If the body is too warm, thermoregulatory ""heat loss"" responses include increasing the skin’s blood flow and/or sweating to facilitate evaporation. If the body is too cold, responses include decreasing the skin’s blood flow and shivering, which produces heat by contracting and relaxing muscles."
The Four Mechanisms of Heating and Cooling the Body;Heat moves from warmer areas to cooler ones through four mechanisms: 1. Radiation: (Warming or cooling) Involves the direct loss or absorption of heat energy through electromagnetic waves. 2. Conduction: (Warming or cooling) Occurs through direct contact with a solid or liquid. Heat loss due to direct contact with cold snow could be decreased by minimizing contact or increasing insulation (e.g., sitting on an insulated pad on the snow). 3. Convection: (Warming or cooling) Occurs when air or liquid moves across the skin. In cold air, this is known as the wind chill factor. Convective heating can also occur if warm air is blown across the skin. 4. Evaporation: (Cooling only) Occurs when a liquid changes to a vapour. This physical process requires heat, which means that evaporation from the skin takes heat from the surface of the body. When sweat or water (either on the skin or in clothing that is in contact with the skin) evaporates, the skin is cooled. Sweating occurs when either the skin and/or body core temperatures increase. In a cold environment, sweating should be minimized (e.g., layers of clothing should be removed before or during hard work). In a hot environment, evaporative heat loss is beneficial. However, any sweat that does not evaporate will not cause cooling. For example, when humidity is high, sweat does not evaporate as efficiently and may simply drip off the body.
Heat-Related Illnesses;Hyperthermia occurs when the body’s core temperature rises above the normal range. It results when at least one of the four mechanisms that cool the body is impaired by clothing, drugs, or disease, or is overwhelmed by internal heat production and/or external heat exposure. Heat-related illnesses will get worse without treatment and can change from one level to another very quickly.
Prevention from Hyperthermia;One of the most important actions a person can take to prevent heatrelated illnesses is to drink plenty of fluids. You should drink eight 250 mL (8 oz.) glasses of fluid a day for low-exertion, routine activities and more as exertion levels increase. It is important to rehydrate regularly during longer events. If you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated, so develop the habit of drinking fluids regularly rather than waiting for the warning signs of dehydration to appear. The following tips will also help to prevent heat-related illness:  Maintain a healthy level of cardiovascular fitness.  Prior to a major event in the heat, let the body gradually acclimatize by being exposed to 1 to 2 hours of heat exertion for at least 8 days.  Avoid being outdoors during the hottest part of the day.  Reduce the intensity of activities as it gets hotter and don’t work or exercise for too long at a time.  Take frequent breaks in a cool or shaded area to cool off. This will help the body cope with short periods of extreme heat.  Dress for the heat and for the intended activity.  Make adjustments to exertion levels and work/rest cycles on hot days (e.g., schedule football practices for cooler parts of the day).  Wear a light hat when under the sun. Wear loose-fitting light clothing that allows liquid and vapour to escape.  Choose hydrating drinks, such as water or juice, over dehydrating ones like alcohol.
Heat Cramps;Heat cramps are painful muscle spasms, usually in the legs and abdomen, caused by loss of fluids and electrolytes as a result of sweating. While they are usually not serious, they are often the first sign that the body is beginning to overheat. What to Look For The following signs and symptoms can indicate heat cramps:  Mild muscle contractions that can become severe, usually in the legs and abdomen  Moist skin A person with heat cramps will typically have a normal or slightly elevated core temperature (37ºC or 98.6ºF).
Care for Heat Cramps;1. Reduce heat exposure (e.g., get into the shade) and, if possible, move the person to a cooler environment. 2. Have the person slowly sip a cool electrolyte-replacement beverage (e.g., commercial sports drink, coconut water, fruit juice, or milk). If a drink containing electrolytes is not available, have the person drink water. 3. Gently stretch and massage the cramped muscles.
Heat Stroke;Heat stroke is the least common but most severe heat-related illness. It is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when the body’s cooling system is completely overwhelmed and stops working. The body stops sweating because the levels of fluid are too low. When sweating stops, the body’s temperature rises quickly. When it gets too high, the brain and other vital organs cannot work properly. The person becomes unresponsive, has seizures, and can die without immediate first aid. What to Look For  High core temperature, above 40°C (104°F)  Hot, dry skin  Flushed (red) or pale skin  Headache  Altered mental status (e.g., confusion)  Irritable, bizarre, or aggressive behaviour  Progressive loss of responsiveness  Rapid, weak pulse that becomes irregular  Rapid, shallow breathing  Vision problems  Seizures or coma
Care for Heat Stroke;1. Move the person to a cooler environment. 2. Quickly lower the person’s core temperature with one of the following methods:  Immerse the person in cool water from the neck down. Do not remove the person’s clothing.  Immerse the person’s forearms and hands in cool water.  Pour cool water on the person’s clothing and/or on towels or cloths and place them on the person’s chest. Fan the person to increase evaporation.  Apply ice or cold packs to the person’s armpits and chest. 3. Continue to use the rapid cooling methods listed above until either the person’s condition improves or EMS personnel arrive. 4. If the person is responsive and able to swallow, have him or her slowly sip a cool electrolyte-replacement beverage (e.g., commercial sports drink, coconut water, fruit juice, or milk). If a drink with electrolytes is not available, give the person water.
Cold-Related Illness;Cold-related illnesses are any conditions that are caused by exposure to colder temperatures. They range in severity from superficial frostbite to life-threatening hypothermia.
Frostbite;"Frostbite is a local, superficial injury caused by freezing of the skin and, in more extreme cases, the underlying tissues. Extremities, such as the toes, feet, fingers, hands, ears, and nose are particularly prone to frostbite. There are two levels of frostbite: Superficial frostbite occurs when the skin freezes but the underlying tissues are unaffected. It may produce clear blisters after the tissue thaws, but little or no tissue loss typically occurs. Deep frostbite occurs when tissues beneath the skin (including tendons, muscles, and blood vessels) freeze. Inside the body, ice crystals and swelling begin to damage or destroy the body’s cells, blood vessels, and nerves. Deep frostbite may produce dark, hemorrhagic blisters when the tissue thaws, and is more likely to result in tissue loss. Before frostbite occurs, a person’s skin may appear shiny and rosy (a condition sometimes called ""frost nip""). This is a warning that frostbite is imminent. If you see these signs, advise the person to move to a warmer environment or protect his or her skin with layers of clothing."
Causes of Frostbite;Factors that increase the risk of frostbite include the following:  Moisture on the skin  Exposure to wind  Insufficient insulation  Clothing or equipment that reduces or constricts blood flow
Prevention from Frostbite;The following tips will help to prevent frostbite:  Never ignore numbness: If an extremity feels numb or tingly, you must take steps to warm it immediately (e.g., put your hands under your armpits or pull your arms inside your jacket for direct skin-toskin contact).  Cover up vulnerable areas such as the cheeks, nose, and ears by wearing clothing that is appropriate for the weather (e.g., scarf, toque, mittens).  Wear mittens instead of gloves when possible, as mittens provide better insulation.  Maximize foot insulation but avoid a tight fit around the toes.  Wear clothing in layers and adjust as necessary so that you feel warm but are not overheating and sweating.  Keep well hydrated.  Keep clothing dry and change out of wet clothing as soon as possible.
Superficial Frostbite;Signs and symptoms of superficial frostbite include:  Hardened skin  Skin that looks paler than the area around it  Pain or stinging in the area, followed by numbness
Deep Frostbite;Signs and symptoms of deep frostbite include:  Waxy skin that is colder than the area around it  Skin and underlying tissue that is hard and solid to the touch  Skin that is white, blue, black, or mottled  Complete loss of feeling
How to deal with Frostbite;Because both hypothermia and frostbite are caused by exposure to the cold, you may be providing care for someone with signs and symptoms of both conditions. Because hypothermia is more serious, however, you should care for it first before caring for the frostbite. 1. If possible, remove jewellery or other extraneous material that may restrict blood flow to the affected area. 2. Thaw the area only if you are sure it will not freeze again. 3. Warm the affected area using warm water, if available (approximately 38 to 40°C (100.4 to 104°F)) or body heat (e.g., by placing the person’s hands in his or her armpits or on the abdomen). You should be able to place your own hands in the water for a minute without feeling too warm. 4. If the frozen area has thawed, don’t break any blisters. Protect them with loose, dry dressings. Place gauze between the fingers or toes if they are affected. 5. If possible, elevate any thawed extremities above the level of the heart. 6. Because thawing frostbite can be extremely painful, the person may wish to take an over-the-counter painkiller. 7. Rehydrate the person by providing plenty of fluids. 8. Encourage the person to seek medical attention.
Hypothermia;Hypothermia occurs when the body’s core temperature (i.e., the temperature of the heart, lungs, and brain) drops to 35°C (95°F) or lower. Hypothermia becomes a life-threatening condition when the core temperature drops below 28°C (82.4°F). People with smaller body types, lower overall body weights, and lower body-fat content are much more likely to experience hypothermia. Hypothermia can occur at any time of year, with young children and the elderly being most at risk. Common Causes The following may lead to hypothermia:  Sweating while outdoors in cold weather  Cold, wet, windy conditions  Cold-water immersion, especially in water below 10°C (50°F)  Dehydration  Taking medications to eliminate water from the body
Prevention from Hypothermia;The following tips will help to prevent hypothermia:  Prepare for activities in cold environments by wearing appropriate clothing:  Wear a hat and clothing made of tightly woven fibres (e.g., wool, fleece), which provide insulation and allow moisture transmission from the skin to the external environment.  Avoid cotton because it soaks up water and stays wet.  Wear clothing in layers so that they can be added or removed according to the weather conditions and exercise intensity. Remove some clothing before working to reduce the amount of sweat and keep clothing dry.  Keep clothing dry. If clothing gets wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible.  Carry and consume high-energy foods that have a lot of sugar.  Drink plenty of warm, high-calorie drinks to help fuel heat production. If high-calorie drinks are not available, drink plenty of water to at least keep from becoming dehydrated.  Do not drink alcohol.  Take frequent breaks from the cold to let the body warm up.  Increase your activity level, add insulation, add a heat source, or get out of the cold if shivering occurs.  Be careful around cold water and always wear a personal flotation device (PFD).
Levels of Cold Stress;"Cold Stress (Not Hypothermic)  Shivering  Normal mental status  Able to care for self Mild Hypothermia  Vigorous shivering; complaining of the cold  Decreased physical function  Difficulty taking care of self Moderate Hypothermia  Weak and intermittent shivering or shivering that later stops  Sometimes complaining of the cold  Lack of coordination or speech; confused or unusual behaviour  Impaired judgment  Possible unresponsiveness Severe Hypothermia  Shivering has stopped  Unresponsiveness; breathing has slowed down or stopped  Body feels stiff  No pulse"
Seasickness;Seasickness (motion sickness) is a sudden illness largely due to the motion of a ship or vessel. People who are not accustomed to the sea are most susceptible, but even experienced seafarers may be affected in rough water conditions. Signs and symptoms of seasickness vary, but include: Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps  Headaches, dizziness, or exhaustion  Cold sweat  Dry mouth
Care for Seasickness;In mild cases, the condition will gradually wear off (often during sleep) and no specific treatment is necessary  Providing small portions of dry food (such as crackers) can help settle the person’s stomach. Sucking on ice chips instead of drinking water will reduce the risk of vomiting while still preventing dehydration  More severe cases of prolonged vomiting may be managed with over-the-counter preventive medications.
Drowning;Drowning occurs when a person’s airway is submerged in water, cutting off the oxygen supply to body. Drowning is a leading cause of death for children and babies. An average of 400 Canadians drown each year. Young children aged 1 to 4 and men aged 15 to 44 are at the greatest risk.
Prevention from Drowning ;The following tips will reduce the risk of drowning:  Always wear a personal flotation device (PFD) when in a boat or other mode of marine transportation.  Supervise children in, on, and around any body of water.  Those who do not swim or are weak swimmers should wear a PFD when in, on, and around any body of water.  Check water depth before swimming or diving.  Have appropriate safety equipment available when in or on the water.  Take Canadian Red Cross Swimming and Water Safety lessons.
Responsive Drowning Person;These common warning signs can indicate that someone is drowning:  The person is vertical in the water, and is not using his or her legs to move forward or tread water.  The person may have an expression of fear.  The person’s arms may be flailing up and down as he or she tries to rise out of the water to breathe, rather than trying to swim forward.  The person’s movements are uncontrolled.
Freezing of Skin to Metal Objects;A person’s skin (especially the tongue and lips) can freeze to cold metal objects. This is especially a risk when skin is wet or moist. While this is a concern mainly in cold weather, skin can also freeze to metal objects in other situations (e.g., skin freezing to cold appliances such as freezers).
Care for freezing of skin to metal objects;1. Do not pull or tug the frozen body part. 2. Pour warm (not hot) water on the surface of the object or the skin that is stuck to the object. 3. As the skin begins to come free, gently help release the person from the metal object. 4. Treat any torn skin as an open wound.
Snow Blindness;Common Causes Snow blindness occurs when a person’s eyes are exposed to ultraviolet rays. It most commonly occurs when the sun’s light is reflected from snow, ice, sand, or water into a person’s eyes. Snow blindness can occur even on cloudy days. To help prevent snow blindness, wear sunglasses that block 100% of UV rays and prevent light from shining in from below, above, or the sides.
Care in case of snow blindness ;1. Place the person in a darker environment, if possible, or cover his or her eyes. 2. Apply a cool, damp cloth to reduce pain and burning. 3. If the person’s vision is affected, seek medical attention.
Prevention from Snow Blindness;To help prevent snow blindness, wear sunglasses that block 100% of UV rays and prevent light from shining in from below, above, or the sides.
Cold-Water Immersion;Cold-water immersion can occur in open water (e.g., when a boat capsizes) or after breaking through the ice. Although hypothermia occurs faster in cold water than cold air, the signs, symptoms, and care are essentially the same. Cold-water immersion has four distinct phases: 1. Cold-Shock Response: Rapid cooling of the skin causes a gasp followed by hyperventilation (lasting 1 to 2 minutes). 2. Cold Incapacitation: Further cooling of nerve and muscle fibres causes weakness and a loss of coordination, leading to incapacitation within approximately 15 minutes. 3. Hypothermia: A person dressed appropriately for the weather conditions will take 30 minutes or more to become mildly hypothermic. 4. Circum-Rescue Collapse: Can occur just prior to, during, or after rescue. The signs and symptoms range from collapsing, to fainting, to cardiac arrest. When rescuing a person from cold water, monitor the person’s condition carefully and be prepared to provide emergency care. Most deaths in cold water result from the Cold-Shock Response (when the head is under water) or drowning due to Cold Incapacitation. A properly worn personal flotation device (PFD) will keep a person afloat after he or she loses the ability to swim during the Cold Incapacitation phase.
How to help a person with cold water immersion;1. If you are in open water, do a self-rescue by getting into a boat, raft, or other mode of marine transportation, if available. 2. If you have fallen through the ice, place your arms on the surface of the ice, kick your legs until your body is horizontal to the water’s surface, and then kick and pull forward until you are on the ice. Roll away from the hole before standing up. If you are in open water and self-rescue is not possible, increase your survival time by doing the following: 1. Get out of the water as much as possible by using a capsized boat or other floating object as a flotation device. 2. If you are wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), adopt the Heat Escape Lessening Position (HELP):  Press your arms against your armpits.  Place your forearms across your chest.  Squeeze your thighs together and raise your knees toward your chest. 3. If several people are together, adopt the HUDDLE position:  Face each other.  Have each person squeeze his or her thighs together.  Form a circle and hug each other. Each person should place one arm above and one arm below the arms of those adjacent, and pull the sides of the chests together.  Sandwich any children or persons without a PFD inside the HUDDLE.
Poisons;A poison is a substance that has a harmful effect within the body if it is inhaled, swallowed (ingested), absorbed, or injected. Poisons are immediately life-threatening if they affect breathing or circulation. Practically anything can be a poison if it is not meant to be taken into the body. Even some substances that are meant to be taken into the body, such as medications, can be poisonous if they are taken by the wrong person, or if the person takes too much. Combining certain substances can also result in poisoning. Poisoning can happen anywhere, but most poisonings take place in the home. Children younger than 5 years, especially toddlers, are at the highest risk for poisoning. Children may be attracted to pretty liquids in bottles, sweet-smelling powders, berries on plants that look like they are edible, or medications or vitamins that look like candy. Additionally, very young children explore their world by touching and tasting things around them, so even substances that do not look or smell attractive are poisoning hazards among this age group. Older adults who have medical conditions that cause confusion (such as dementia) or who have impaired vision are also at a higher risk of unintentional poisoning. When providing first aid for a poisoned person, use caution to avoid contact with the poison.
Swallowed Poison;Enters the body through the mouth, lips, esophagus, or stomach. Drinking bleach is an example of swallowed poisoning. The following may indicate that a poisonous substance has been swallowed:  An open container of poison nearby  Burns around the mouth  Increased production of saliva or saliva that is an abnormal colour  Abdominal cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea  Seizures  Dizziness or drowsiness  Unresponsiveness  A burning sensation in the mouth, throat, or stomach
Absorbed Poison;Enters the body through the skin. Plants (such as poison ivy) and chemicals can cause absorbed poisoning. The following signs and symptoms can indicate that a poisonous substance has been absorbed:  Rash or hives (raised, itchy areas of skin)  Burning or itching skin  Swelling  Blisters  Burns  Unresponsiveness
Injected Poison;Enters the body through bites or stings or as drugs injected with a needle.
Inhaled Poison;Is breathed into the body. Breathing in carbon monoxide from a car’s exhaust is an example of inhaled poisoning.The following may indicate that a poisonous substance has been inhaled:  Breathing difficulties  Irritated eyes, nose, or throat  Dizziness  Vomiting  Seizures  Bluish colour around the mouth  Unresponsiveness  An unusual smell in the air
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning;"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no smell, colour, or taste. CO poisoning is often called a ""silent killer"" because it is not detectable to any of the body’s senses. CO bonds to red blood cells 200 times better than oxygen, preventing oxygen from attaching and therefore starving the body of oxygen. It releases when fuel is burned in small engines, lanterns, fireplaces, stoves, grills, gas ranges, furnaces, cars, and trucks. When equipment that burns these fuels is properly ventilated, CO poisoning is not a problem. But if the equipment or ventilation system is faulty, or if outdoor equipment is used in an enclosed area, toxic levels of CO can build up quickly, creating the risk of CO poisoning. Concentrated CO is poisonous and life-threatening to those who inhale it."
Prevention from CO2 poisoning;The following tips help prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning:  Ensure that a battery-operated or battery back-up CO detector is installed in the home or workplace where the alarm will be easily heard.  Check the CO detector’s batteries twice a year, ideally once in the fall and once in the spring.  Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment installed and repaired by a qualified technician.  Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment serviced annually by a qualified professional.  Use fuel-based appliances and materials as intended (e.g., do not use generators or portable flameless chemical heaters indoors, do not use a gas stove or oven for heating, do not burn charcoal indoors).  Ensure that chimneys are inspected and cleaned annually by a professional.  Never run a car or truck inside an attached garage. For detached garages, always leave the garage door open when running a car or truck inside.
Care for Absorbed Poisoning;1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. 2. If the poison is a dry powder, brush it off the person’s skin. Be careful to avoid contaminating yourself. 3. Remove any clothing or items covered in the poison. 4. Flush the skin with running water for at least 15 minutes. To prevent any further injury, make sure the water flushes away from any unaffected areas of the body.
Care for Inhaled Poisoning;1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. Use a barrier device so that you don’t contaminate yourself with the poison. 2. Get the person into fresh air but do not enter into a hazardous atmosphere in order to do so. Inhaled poisons can affect everyone in an area. Stay out of the area if you suspect that the poison may still be in the air.
Prevention from Swallowed poisoning;1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. Use a barrier device so that you don’t contaminate yourself with the poison. 2. Check the packaging of the poison, if possible, so that you know what it is. 3. Induce vomiting only if told to do so by the EMS dispatcher or the Poison Control Centre. 4. If the person needs to go to the hospital, bring a sample of the poison (or its original container).
Injected Poisons;Needles found nearby are a common sign that an injected poisoning has occurred. The following are other signs and symptoms that indicate a poisonous substance has been injected:  One or more puncture wounds on the person’s skin  Problems breathing  Redness and swelling at the entry point on the person’s skin
Drug Overdose;Drugs (whether over-the-counter, prescription, or illegal) are a frequent cause of death by poisoning. Drug overdoses may be accidental or intentional. Signs and symptoms will vary depending on the drug.
Stimulants;Stimulants affect the brain and nerves to speed up physical and mental activity.  Many stimulants are swallowed as pills, but some can be absorbed or inhaled.
Hallucinogens;Hallucinogens cause changes in mood, sensation, thought, emotion, and self-awareness.  They can cause intense fear, panic, paranoid delusions, vivid hallucinations, deep depression, tension, and anxiety.
Depressants;Depressants send signals to the brain and nerves that slow down physical and mental activity.  They cause drowsiness and impair coordination and judgment.  Alcohol is the most widely used and abused depressant in Germany.
Designer Drugs;Designer drugs don’t fit into any of the categories mentioned above.  They are often chemically altered versions of medical drugs, such as narcotics and amphetamines.  Their effects can be unpredictable and dangerous.  Ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, and LSD are examples of designer drugs.
The signs and symptoms of drug poisoning;The signs and symptoms of drug poisoning will vary depending on the drug but often include the following:  Moist or flushed skin  Sweating  Chills or fever  Nausea or vomiting  Vomiting blood or passing blood  Changes in breathing or difficulty breathing  Racing or pounding heart  Continuous pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen  Seizures  Severe headache  Slurred speech  Changes in level of responsiveness  Changes in behaviour (e.g., aggression or fear)
Care for drug poisoning;1. Try to find out from others at the scene what substance or substances the person may have taken, and then communicate that information to EMS personnel or the Poison Control Centre 164 worker.
Opioid Overdose;Opioid drugs, such as heroin, oxycodone, and fentanyl, are a common cause of drug overdose in Canada. Many prescription drugs are or contain opiates. EMS personnel use naloxone (Narcan®) to reverse the effects of opioid drugs. In some provinces, First Aiders, first responders, and people in high-risk addiction situations can receive training in administering naloxone. Naloxone can be supplied as a nasal spray or an injectable solution.
Naloxone and Opioid Drug Overdoses;Naloxone is used to quickly reverse the effects of an opioid drug overdose, specifically counteracting central nervous system depression and respiratory depression. Administering naloxone requires special training. If you are trained and naloxone is available, you can give naloxone to someone suffering from an opioid drug overdose, as this is an effective and lifesaving treatment.
Signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose;Signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose include the following:  Slowed breathing (or no breathing)  Chest tightness  Extreme drowsiness or unresponsiveness  Small pupils
Care for Opioid overdose;1. If the person is unresponsive and not breathing, begin CPR. Do not delay CPR treatment to give the person naloxone. 2. If the person is unresponsive but is breathing, and if you have received training in its use, give the person naloxone by following the instructions on the label. Always follow specific policies and the training you have received in providing naloxone. 3. Stay with the person and provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive. Ensure that the person receives professional medical care, as naloxone alone is not enough to care for a person who has overdosed on opioids.
Alcohol Poisoning;Alcohol is a depressant that affects the central nervous system. It impairs judgment, slows down reflexes, and makes driving unsafe. Very high levels of alcohol in the bloodstream can affect the brain’s ability to control the body’s breathing, heart rate, and temperature, which can lead to death. Alcohol poisoning occurs when large quantities of alcohol are consumed in a short period of time, resulting in toxic levels of alcohol in the body.
Factors of Alcohol Poisoning;There are many factors that can contribute to an unsafe blood alcohol level:  Speed of drinking  Full or empty stomach  Type of alcohol  The person’s weight and sex
Symptoms of Alcohol Poisoning;The signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning include the following:  Confusion  Vomiting  Seizures  Slow or irregular breathing  Low body temperature (hypothermia)  Unresponsiveness  Blue-tinged skin or skin that is paler than normal
Care for Alcohol Poisoning;1. Roll the person into the recovery position. 2. Carefully monitor the person until EMS personnel arrive, as his or her condition can deteriorate rapidly
Animal Bites;Any animal that has teeth, whether domesticated (e.g., pets or livestock) or wild, can be the source of a bite wound. If the person does not know the animal, rabies may be a concern. Most animal bites carry a high risk of infection, so they should be monitored closely in the hours and days after the incident.
Care for animal bites ;1. Try to get the person safely away from the animal without putting yourself in danger. 2. Do not try to capture the animal. 3. If the wound is bleeding heavily, provide care for external bleeding. 4. If the wound is minor:  Wash the wound thoroughly with clean water, ideally by running it under a tap, as the pressure from the running water lets it penetrate more deeply into the wound.  Control any bleeding.  Encourage the person to apply antibiotic ointment or cream to the wound, if they have no known allergies or sensitivities. 166  Cover the wound with a dressing or bandage. 5. Seek medical attention if the animal is wild, stray, or unknown to you, or if you suspect the animal might have rabies. 6. Watch for signs and symptoms of infection and ensure that the person continues to monitor the wound over the next several days.
Insect Stings;Most of the time, insect stings are merely uncomfortable. However, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are always a concern. Some insects, such as bees, leave their stingers embedded in the person’s skin. Others, such as wasps, can sting multiple times, but leave no stinger behind.
Prevention from Insect Stings;To reduce the risk of insect stings:  Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed-toe shoes.  Don’t wear perfume, cologne, or other products with strong scents.  Remove or cover items that will attract insects, such as garbage or food.
Signs and symptoms of insect stings;The following can indicate an insect sting, especially if you see insects nearby:  Quick, sharp pain at the site of the sting  Pain, redness, or swelling at the site of the sting  A stinger embedded in the skin
Care for Insect Stings;1. If the stinger is still in the person’s skin, remove it by scraping it away from the skin. Use a plastic card (such as a debit card) to do this. 2. Wash the area with clean water. 3. Cover the site with an adhesive bandage. 4. Apply ice or a cold pack to help control swelling. Put a thin cloth between the cold source and the person’s skin to avoid freezing the skin. 5. Continue to watch for signs of infection, an allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis.
Tick Bites;Ticks are found in wooded, bushy areas, in tall grass, and in leaf litter on the ground. They can attach themselves to any warm-blooded animal that they come into direct contact with, including people. When ticks attach themselves to the skin, they can spread pathogens from their mouths into the person’s body. These pathogens can cause serious illnesses, such as Lyme disease. Promptly remove any ticks that you find before they become swollen with blood. Ticks are most active from April to September.
Prevention from Tick Bites;Tips to help prevent tick bites include the following:  Avoid wooded areas and areas with high grass and leaf litter.  Walk in the centre of hiking trails.  Limit the amount of exposed skin. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Tuck your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your socks or boots.  Use insect repellents with 10 to 30% DEET on skin and clothing. A parent, guardian, or caregiver should apply repellents to children, carefully avoiding the eyes, mouth, and hands.  Check gear and pets for ticks when coming in from outside.  Immediately after being outdoors, do a head-to-toe check for ticks using a hand-held or full-length mirror. Check the scalp, under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the navel, around the waist, behind the knees, and between the legs. If you are outdoors for an extended period of time, check several times throughout the day. Caregivers and parents or guardians should check children for ticks.  Put outdoor clothing in a tumble dryer on high heat for 1 hour to kill any ticks that might be attached.  When walking with children in a tick-infested area, prevent ticks from entering their clothing by using a rubber band or tape to seal the area where children’s pants and socks meet.
Using Insect Repellents to Prevent Tick Bites;Consider using an insect repellent if you will be in a grassy or wooded area for a long period of time, or if you know that the tick population in the area is high. Use repellents sparingly, as one application will last 4 to 8 hours and heavier or more frequent applications do not increase effectiveness.
Care for tick bites;1. Use tweezers to grasp the tick by the head as close to the person’s skin as possible. 2. Pull upward slowly and steadily without twisting until the tick releases its hold. If you cannot remove the tick or if its mouthparts stay in the skin, the person should seek medical attention. 3. If the tick is removed, wash the area with clean tap water. The pressure of the running water lets it penetrate more deeply into the wound. 4. If possible, save the tick in a resealable bag and record the date of the bite. 5. Advise the person to monitor the bite for several days for signs and symptoms of infection. If the area becomes infected (i.e., it becomes red, warm, or painful), or the person develops a fever, he or she should seek medical attention. Ticks can be infected with more than one type of bacteria that can cause human illness. Signs can appear weeks to months after a bite. If a person feels unwell after a tick bite, he or she should seek medical attention.
Lyme Disease;Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that are transmitted to humans through bites from infected ticks. If Lyme disease is not treated, it can become a chronic condition with serious symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, joint and muscle pain, and neurological disorders.
Syptoms of Lyme disease;The most distinctive sign of Lyme disease is a small red rash centred on the location of the bite in the shape of a bullseye (a red dot on a paler circle with an outer red ring). These rashes are typically 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) across. Other signs and symptoms of Lyme disease include:  Fatigue  Headache  Fever or chills  Swollen lymph nodes  Numbness or tingling  Muscle spasms or weakness  Joint and muscle pain (similar in feeling to the flu)
What to do in case of Lyme disease;Seek medical attention as soon as possible. If possible, save the tick responsible for the bite in a resealable bag or empty pill bottle, and bring it to the medical appointment. It may help the doctor diagnose the illness.
Snakebites;In the wild, snakes like to occupy rock outcrops, swamps, undergrowth, and abandoned human structures. When disturbed, some snakes can inject venom as they bite. The vast majority of Canada’s snakes are non-venomous, but there are three venomous snakes currently native to Canada. All three are rattlesnakes: 1. Northern Pacific Rattlesnake 2. Massasauga Rattlesnake 3. Prairie Rattlesnake. Other venomous snakes in North America include copperheads, cottonmouths (water moccasins), and coral snakes. Most deaths from venomous snakebites occur because:  Too much time passed before the person received medical care.  The person had an allergic reaction to the venom.  The snake bite compounded an existing health condition in the person.
Prevention from Snakebites;The following steps will help prevent snakebites:  Do not aggravate a snake.  Wear proper footwear and watch where you put your feet when hiking. If you hear a rattlesnake, remain still until the snake is located, then back away slowly: avoid stomping or jumping as this may startle the snake.
Spider Bites;Very few spiders in Canada can cause serious illness or death. The bites of harmless spiders often cause reactions similar to those of bee stings (e.g., swelling, redness, and stinging or pain at the site). However, two types of venomous spiders are occasionally encountered in Canada: the brown recluse and the black widow. The bite of either spider can, in rare cases, be life-threatening.
Black Widow Spiders;"The black widow spider is black with a reddish hourglass shape on the underside of its body. Its bite is the most painful and deadly of all the widow spiders, especially for very young children and older adults. The bite usually causes an immediate, sharp, ""pin-prick"" pain, followed by dull pain in the area of the bite. However, the person often does not know that he or she has been bitten until he or she starts to feel ill or notices a bite mark or swelling. The signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bite (e.g., abdominal cramps), can mimic those of other medical emergencies. Anyone with a suspected bite should be seen by a doctor for correct diagnosis and treatment."
Brown Recluse Spiders;The brown recluse spider has a distinctive violin-shaped pattern on the back of its front body section. At first, the bite may produce little or no pain. Pain in the area of the bite develops an hour or more later. A blood-filled blister forms under the surface of the skin, sometimes in a target or bull’seye pattern. Over several hours, the blister increases in size and eventually ruptures, leading to tissue destruction and a black scab.
Signs and symptoms of spider bites;Signs and symptoms of spider bites depend on the amount of venom injected and the person’s sensitivity to the venom. Most spider bites heal with no adverse effects or scarring. Signs and symptoms of venomous spider bites can seem identical to those of other conditions and therefore can be difficult to recognize. The only way for a First Aider to be certain that a venomous spider has bitten a person is to have witnessed it.
Black Widow Spider Bite;Signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bite include the following:  A raised, round, red mark  Cramping pain in the thighs, shoulders, back, and abdominal muscles  Restlessness and anxiety  Dizziness  Headache  Excessive sweating  Weakness
Brown Recluse Spider Bite;Signs and symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite include the following:  A slight stinging sensation (though bites may not be initially felt)  A blood-filled blister that appears within 2 to 8 hours  A bull’s-eye pattern around the bite Signs and symptoms of a severe reaction to a brown recluse spider bite occur within 72 hours of the bite and include nausea, vomiting, and joint pain.
To care for a bite from a non-venomous spider;1. Wash the area with water. 2. Suggest that the person apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound if the person has no known allergies or sensitivities. 3. Apply a cold pack wrapped in a thin, dry towel to help reduce pain and swelling.
To care for a spider bite from a black widow spider or a brown recluse spider:;1. Wash the area with water. 2. Apply a cold pack wrapped in a thin, dry towel.
